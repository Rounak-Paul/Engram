c language codebase, no comments in code, do not put not implemented code, follow standard C language case for struct, variables and etc names, performance first, cpu cache hit first, no malloc in loops and no memory leak, follow the existing code style, no legacy compatibility, all refactors must be complete and through, no partial implementations, no duplicate logic, code should not look like AI generated. Proper industry standard implementations. No corner cutting in implementations. No left over backward compatibility or dead code. No duplicate logics, need modular and reusable design and code.
