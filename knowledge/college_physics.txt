Introduction: The Nature of Science and
Physics




FIGURE 1.1 The laws of physics describe the smallest and largest forces and structures, such as the Veil Nebula, a supernova remnant from
a star that was 20 times larger than our Sun. Stretching over 110 light years across, the spectacular image is created by the stellar
explosion's blast wave impacting clouds of gas. Scientists use successive observations of the still-moving wave to learn about nebula
formation in ways they can apply to other systems. The laws of physics are surprisingly few in number, implying an underlying simplicity to
nature’s apparent complexity. (credit: NASA, ESA, Hubble Heritage, and the Digitized Sky Survey 2)

INTRODUCTION TO SCIENCE AND THE REALM OF PHYSICS, PHYSICAL QUANTITIES, AND UNITS What is your
first reaction when you hear the word “physics”? Did you imagine working through difficult equations or memorizing
formulas that seem to have no real use in life outside the physics classroom? Many people come to the subject of
physics with a bit of fear. But as you begin your exploration of this broad-ranging subject, you may soon come to
realize that physics plays a much larger role in your life than you first thought, no matter your life goals or career
choice.

Consider the Veil Nebula, a cloud of heated dust and gas located about 2,400 light years from Earth (a light year is
the distance light travels in one year, or approximately 9.5 trillion kilometers). The unique structure is the ongoing
result of a supernova that occurred 8,000 years ago. The shock wave from the explosion is colliding with a cloud of
gas and dust, creating the rope-like filaments and sheet-like appearance. Scientists compare newer images, such as
the one above, with detailed images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997 in order to understand nebula
expansion and other properties of astronomical objects. The forces that cause the supernova remnant to act as it
6   1 • Introduction: The Nature of Science and Physics



    does are the same forces we contend with here on Earth, whether we are planning to send a rocket into space or
    simply heating a new home. Although the scale is much different, the interaction of gasses in the Veil Nebula
    resembles those on Earth; and the vibrant color combinations are created by the familiar glows of hydrogen, sulfur,
    oxygen, and similar elements that make up everything we know. Tonight, take a moment to look up at the stars. The
    forces out there are the same as the ones here on Earth. Through a study of physics, you may gain a greater
    understanding of the interconnectedness of everything we can see and know in this universe.

    Humans have created and manufactured millions of different objects over the history of our species. Successive
    technological periods (often referred to as the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, and so on) were marked by
    our knowledge of the physical properties of certain materials and our ability to manipulate them. This knowledge all
    stems from physics, whether it's the way a rock would flake when constructing a spear point, the effect of
    integrating carbon with iron in South Indian and Sri Lankan furnaces to create the earliest high-quality steel, or the
    proper way to combine perfectly ground and polished pieces of glass to create optical instruments. Our current
    technological age, the Information Age, builds on all that knowledge and can be traced to critical innovations made
    by people from all backgrounds working together. Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng, for example, invented the
    MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor). Although unknown to most people, this tiny device,
    created in 1959 by an Egyptian-born scientist and Korean-born scientist working in a lab in New Jersey, is the basis
    for modern electronics. More MOSFETs have been produced than any other object in human history. They are used
    in computers, smart phones, microwave ovens, automotive controls, medical instruments, and nearly every other
    electronic device.

    Next, think about the most exciting modern technologies that you have heard about in the news, such as trains that
    levitate above tracks, “invisibility cloaks” that bend light around them, and microscopic robots that fight cancer cells
    in our bodies. All of these groundbreaking advancements, commonplace or unbelievable, rely on the principles of
    physics. Aside from playing a significant role in technology, professionals such as engineers, pilots, physicians,
    physical therapists, electricians, and computer programmers apply physics concepts in their daily work. For
    example, a pilot must understand how wind forces affect a flight path and a physical therapist must understand how
    the muscles in the body experience forces as they move and bend. As you will learn in this text, physics principles
    are propelling new, exciting technologies, and these principles are applied in a wide range of careers.

    In this text, you will begin to explore the history of the formal study of physics, beginning with natural philosophy
    and the ancient thinkers from the Middle East and the Mediterranean, and leading up through a review of Sir Isaac
    Newton and the laws of physics that bear his name. You will also be introduced to the standards scientists use when
    they study physical quantities and the interrelated system of measurements most of the scientific community uses
    to communicate in a single mathematical language. Finally, you will study the limits of our ability to be accurate and
    precise, and the reasons scientists go to painstaking lengths to be as clear as possible regarding their own
    limitations.

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:
     • Explain the difference between a principle and a law.

  FIGURE 1.2 The flight formations of migratory birds such as Canada geese are governed by the laws of physics. (credit: David Merrett)

The physical universe is enormously complex in its detail. Every day, each of us observes a great variety of objects
and phenomena. Over the centuries, the curiosity of the human race has led us collectively to explore and catalog a
tremendous wealth of information. From the flight of birds to the colors of flowers, from lightning to gravity, from
quarks to clusters of galaxies, from the flow of time to the mystery of the creation of the universe, we have asked
questions and assembled huge arrays of facts. In the face of all these details, we have discovered that a surprisingly
small and unified set of physical laws can explain what we observe. As humans, we make generalizations and seek
order. We have found that nature is remarkably cooperative—it exhibits the underlying order and simplicity we so
value.

It is the underlying order of nature that makes science in general, and physics in particular, so enjoyable to study.
For example, what do a bag of chips and a car battery have in common? Both contain energy that can be converted
to other forms. The law of conservation of energy (which says that energy can change form but is never lost) ties
together such topics as food calories, batteries, heat, light, and watch springs. Understanding this law makes it
easier to learn about the various forms energy takes and how they relate to one another. Apparently unrelated topics
are connected through broadly applicable physical laws, permitting an understanding beyond just the memorization
of lists of facts.

The unifying aspect of physical laws and the basic simplicity of nature form the underlying themes of this text. In
learning to apply these laws, you will, of course, study the most important topics in physics. More importantly, you
will gain analytical abilities that will enable you to apply these laws far beyond the scope of what can be included in
a single book. These analytical skills will help you to excel academically, and they will also help you to think critically
in any professional career you choose to pursue. This module discusses the realm of physics (to define what physics
is), some applications of physics (to illustrate its relevance to other disciplines), and more precisely what constitutes
a physical law (to illuminate the importance of experimentation to theory).

Science and the Realm of Physics
Science consists of the theories and laws that are the general truths of nature as well as the body of knowledge they
encompass. Scientists are continually trying to expand this body of knowledge and to perfect the expression of the
laws that describe it. Physics is concerned with describing the interactions of energy, matter, space, and time, and it
is especially interested in what fundamental mechanisms underlie every phenomenon. The concern for describing
the basic phenomena in nature essentially defines the realm of physics.

Physics aims to describe the function of everything around us, from the movement of tiny charged particles to the
motion of people, cars, and spaceships. In fact, almost everything around you can be described quite accurately by
the laws of physics. Consider a smart phone (Figure 1.3). Physics describes how electricity interacts with the various
circuits inside the device. This knowledge helps engineers select the appropriate materials and circuit layout when
building the smart phone. Next, consider a GPS system. Physics describes the relationship between the speed of an
object, the distance over which it travels, and the time it takes to travel that distance. GPS relies on precise
calculations that account for variations in the Earth's landscapes, the exact distance between orbiting satellites, and
even the effect of a complex occurrence of time dilation. Most of these calculations are founded on algorithms
developed by Gladys West, a mathematician and computer scientist who programmed the first computers capable
of highly accurate remote sensing and positioning. When you use a GPS device, it utilizes these algorithms to
8   1 • Introduction: The Nature of Science and Physics



    recognize where you are and how your position relates to other objects on Earth.

    many other functions. Physics describes the way that electricity flows through the circuits of this device. Engineers use their knowledge of
    physics to construct an iPhone with features that consumers will enjoy. One specific feature of an iPhone is the GPS function. GPS uses
    physics equations to determine the driving time between two locations on a map. (credit: Tinh tế Photo/Flickr)

    Applications of Physics
    You need not be a scientist to use physics. On the contrary, knowledge of physics is useful in everyday situations as
    well as in nonscientific professions. It can help you understand how microwave ovens work, why metals should not
    be put into them, and why they might affect pacemakers. (See Figure 1.4 and Figure 1.5.) Physics allows you to
    understand the hazards of radiation and rationally evaluate these hazards more easily. Physics also explains the
    reason why a black car radiator helps remove heat in a car engine, and it explains why a white roof helps keep the
    inside of a house cool. Similarly, the operation of a car’s ignition system as well as the transmission of electrical
    signals through our body’s nervous system are much easier to understand when you think about them in terms of
    basic physics.

    Physics is the foundation of many important disciplines and contributes directly to others. Chemistry, for
    example—since it deals with the interactions of atoms and molecules—is rooted in atomic and molecular physics.
    Most branches of engineering are applied physics. In architecture, physics is at the heart of structural stability, and
    is involved in the acoustics, heating, lighting, and cooling of buildings. Parts of geology rely heavily on physics, such
    as radioactive dating of rocks, earthquake analysis, and heat transfer in the Earth. Some disciplines, such as
    biophysics and geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines.

    Physics has many applications in the biological sciences. On the microscopic level, it helps describe the properties
    of cell walls and cell membranes (Figure 1.6 and Figure 1.7). On the macroscopic level, it can explain the heat, work,
    and power associated with the human body. Physics is involved in medical diagnostics, such as x-rays, magnetic
    resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonic blood flow measurements. Medical therapy sometimes directly involves
    physics; for example, cancer radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation. Physics can also explain sensory phenomena,
    such as how musical instruments make sound, how the eye detects color, and how lasers can transmit information.

    It is not necessary to formally study all applications of physics. What is most useful is knowledge of the basic laws of
    physics and a skill in the analytical methods for applying them. The study of physics also can improve your problem-
    solving skills. Furthermore, physics has retained the most basic aspects of science, so it is used by all of the
    sciences, and the study of physics makes other sciences easier to understand.

     Models, Theories, and Laws; The Role of Experimentation
     The laws of nature are concise descriptions of the universe around us; they are human statements of the underlying
     laws or rules that all natural processes follow. Such laws are intrinsic to the universe; humans did not create them
     and so cannot change them. We can only discover and understand them. Their discovery is a very human endeavor,
     with all the elements of mystery, imagination, struggle, triumph, and disappointment inherent in any creative effort.
     (See Figure 1.8 and Figure 1.9.) The cornerstone of discovering natural laws is observation; science must describe
     the universe as it is, not as we may imagine it to be.




     FIGURE 1.8 Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was very reluctant to publish his revolutionary work and had to be convinced to do so. In his later
     years, he stepped down from his academic post and became exchequer of the Royal Mint. He took this post seriously, inventing reeding (or
     creating ridges) on the edge of coins to prevent unscrupulous people from trimming the silver off of them before using them as currency.

We all are curious to some extent. We look around, make generalizations, and try to understand what we see—for
example, we look up and wonder whether one type of cloud signals an oncoming storm. As we become serious
about exploring nature, we become more organized and formal in collecting and analyzing data. We attempt greater
precision, perform controlled experiments (if we can), and write down ideas about how the data may be organized
and unified. We then formulate models, theories, and laws based on the data we have collected and analyzed to
generalize and communicate the results of these experiments.

A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to display directly. While a model
is justified with experimental proof, it is only accurate under limited situations. An example is the planetary model of
the atom in which electrons are pictured as orbiting the nucleus, analogous to the way planets orbit the Sun. (See
Figure 1.10.) We cannot observe electron orbits directly, but the mental image helps explain the observations we
can make, such as the emission of light from hot gases (atomic spectra). Physicists use models for a variety of
purposes. For example, models can help physicists analyze a scenario and perform a calculation, or they can be
used to represent a situation in the form of a computer simulation. A theory is an explanation for patterns in nature
that is supported by scientific evidence and verified multiple times by various groups of researchers. Some theories
include models to help visualize phenomena, whereas others do not. Newton’s theory of gravity, for example, does
not require a model or mental image, because we can observe the objects directly with our own senses. The kinetic
theory of gases, on the other hand, is a model in which a gas is viewed as being composed of atoms and molecules.
Atoms and molecules are too small to be observed directly with our senses—thus, we picture them mentally to
understand what our instruments tell us about the behavior of gases.

A law uses concise language to describe a generalized pattern in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and
repeated experiments. Often, a law can be expressed in the form of a single mathematical equation. Laws and
theories are similar in that they are both scientific statements that result from a tested hypothesis and are
supported by scientific evidence. However, the designation law is reserved for a concise and very general statement
that describes phenomena in nature, such as the law that energy is conserved during any process, or Newton’s
second law of motion, which relates force, mass, and acceleration by the simple equation             . A theory, in
contrast, is a less concise statement of observed phenomena. For example, the Theory of Evolution and the Theory
of Relativity cannot be expressed concisely enough to be considered a law. The biggest difference between a law
and a theory is that a theory is much more complex and dynamic. A law describes a single action, whereas a theory
explains an entire group of related phenomena. And, whereas a law is a postulate that forms the foundation of the
scientific method, a theory is the end result of that process.

Less broadly applicable statements are usually called principles (such as Pascal’s principle, which is applicable only
in fluids), but the distinction between laws and principles often is not carefully made.
12   1 • Introduction: The Nature of Science and Physics




     FIGURE 1.10 What is a model? This planetary model of the atom shows electrons orbiting the nucleus. It is a drawing that we use to form a
     mental image of the atom that we cannot see directly with our eyes because it is too small.


       Models, Theories, and Laws
       Models, theories, and laws are used to help scientists analyze the data they have already collected. However,
       often after a model, theory, or law has been developed, it points scientists toward new discoveries they would
       not otherwise have made.


     The models, theories, and laws we devise sometimes imply the existence of objects or phenomena as yet
     unobserved. These predictions are remarkable triumphs and tributes to the power of science. It is the underlying
     order in the universe that enables scientists to make such spectacular predictions. However, if experiment does not
     verify our predictions, then the theory or law is wrong, no matter how elegant or convenient it is. Laws can never be
     known with absolute certainty because it is impossible to perform every imaginable experiment in order to confirm a
     law in every possible scenario. Physicists operate under the assumption that all scientific laws and theories are valid
     until a counterexample is observed. If a good-quality, verifiable experiment contradicts a well-established law, then
     the law must be modified or overthrown completely.

     The study of science in general and physics in particular is an adventure much like the exploration of uncharted
     ocean. Discoveries are made; models, theories, and laws are formulated; and the beauty of the physical universe is
     made more sublime for the insights gained.


       The Scientific Method
       Ibn al-Haytham (sometimes referred to as Alhazen), a 10th-11th century scientist working in Cairo, significantly
       advanced the understanding of optics and vision. But his contributions go much further. In demonstrating that
       previous approaches were incorrect, he emphasized that scientists must be ready to reject existing knowledge
       and become "the enemy" of everything they read; he expressed that scientists must trust only objective
       evidence. Al-Haytham emphasized repeated experimentation and validation, and acknowledged that senses and
       predisposition could lead to poor conclusions. His work was a precursor to the scientific method that we use
       today.

       As scientists inquire and gather information about the world, they follow a process called the scientific method.
       This process typically begins with an observation and question that the scientist will research. Next, the scientist
       typically performs some research about the topic and then devises a hypothesis. Then, the scientist will test the
       hypothesis by performing an experiment. Finally, the scientist analyzes the results of the experiment and draws
       a conclusion. Note that the scientific method can be applied to many situations that are not limited to science,
       and this method can be modified to suit the situation.

       Consider an example. Let us say that you try to turn on your car, but it will not start. You undoubtedly wonder:
       Why will the car not start? You can follow a scientific method to answer this question. First off, you may perform
       some research to determine a variety of reasons why the car will not start. Next, you will state a hypothesis. For
       example, you may believe that the car is not starting because it has no engine oil. To test this, you open the hood
       of the car and examine the oil level. You observe that the oil is at an acceptable level, and you thus conclude that
       the oil level is not contributing to your car issue. To troubleshoot the issue further, you may devise a new

  hypothesis to test and then repeat the process again.


The Evolution of Natural Philosophy into Modern Physics
Physics was not always a separate and distinct discipline. It remains connected to other sciences to this day. The
word physics comes from Greek, meaning nature. The study of nature came to be called “natural philosophy.” From
ancient times through the Renaissance, natural philosophy encompassed many fields, including astronomy, biology,
chemistry, physics, mathematics, and medicine. Over the last few centuries, the growth of knowledge has resulted
in ever-increasing specialization and branching of natural philosophy into separate fields, with physics retaining the
most basic facets. (See Figure 1.11, Figure 1.12, and Figure 1.13.) Physics as it developed from the Renaissance to
the end of the 19th century is called classical physics. It was transformed into modern physics by revolutionary
discoveries made starting at the beginning of the 20th century.




FIGURE 1.11 Over the centuries, natural philosophy has evolved into more specialized disciplines, as illustrated by the contributions of
some of the greatest minds in history. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) wrote on a broad range of topics including physics,
animals, the soul, politics, and poetry. (credit: Jastrow (2006)/Ludovisi Collection)




FIGURE 1.12 Ibn al-Haytham (965–1040) and Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) were so critical to the advancement of scientific practice and to
the fields of mathematics, optics, physics, and astronomy that a later prominent scientist featured them on the cover of his major work.

     Classical physics is not an exact description of the universe, but it is an excellent approximation under the following
     conditions: Matter must be moving at speeds less than about 1% of the speed of light, the objects dealt with must
     be large enough to be seen with a microscope, and only weak gravitational fields, such as the field generated by the
     Earth, can be involved. Because humans live under such circumstances, classical physics seems intuitively
     reasonable, while many aspects of modern physics seem bizarre. This is why models are so useful in modern
     physics—they let us conceptualize phenomena we do not ordinarily experience. We can relate to models in human
     terms and visualize what happens when objects move at high speeds or imagine what objects too small to observe
     with our senses might be like. For example, we can understand an atom’s properties because we can picture it in our
     minds, although we have never seen an atom with our eyes. New tools, of course, allow us to better picture
     phenomena we cannot see. In fact, new instrumentation has allowed us in recent years to actually “picture” the
     atom.


       Limits on the Laws of Classical Physics
       For the laws of classical physics to apply, the following criteria must be met: Matter must be moving at speeds
       less than about 1% of the speed of light, the objects dealt with must be large enough to be seen with a
       microscope, and only weak gravitational fields (such as the field generated by the Earth) can be involved.

     Erwinrossen)

     Some of the most spectacular advances in science have been made in modern physics. Many of the laws of classical
     physics have been modified or rejected, and revolutionary changes in technology, society, and our view of the
     universe have resulted. Like science fiction, modern physics is filled with fascinating objects beyond our normal
     experiences, but it has the advantage over science fiction of being very real. Why, then, is the majority of this text
     devoted to topics of classical physics? There are two main reasons: Classical physics gives an extremely accurate
     description of the universe under a wide range of everyday circumstances, and knowledge of classical physics is
     necessary to understand modern physics.

     Modern physics itself consists of the two revolutionary theories, relativity and quantum mechanics. These theories

deal with the very fast and the very small, respectively. Relativity must be used whenever an object is traveling at
greater than about 1% of the speed of light or experiences a strong gravitational field such as that near the Sun.
Quantum mechanics must be used for objects smaller than can be seen with a microscope. The combination of
these two theories is relativistic quantum mechanics, and it describes the behavior of small objects traveling at high
speeds or experiencing a strong gravitational field. Relativistic quantum mechanics is the best universally applicable
theory we have. Because of its mathematical complexity, it is used only when necessary, and the other theories are
used whenever they will produce sufficiently accurate results. We will find, however, that we can do a great deal of
modern physics with the algebra and trigonometry used in this text.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
A friend tells you they have learned about a new law of nature. What can you know about the information even
before your friend describes the law? How would the information be different if your friend told you they had learned
about a scientific theory rather than a law?
Solution
Without knowing the details of the law, you can still infer that the information your friend has learned conforms to
the requirements of all laws of nature: it will be a concise description of the universe around us; a statement of the
underlying rules that all natural processes follow. If the information had been a theory, you would be able to infer
that the information will be a large-scale, broadly applicable generalization.

1.2 Physical Quantities and Units
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Perform unit conversions both in the SI and English units.
 • Explain the most common prefixes in the SI units and be able to write them in scientific notation.




FIGURE 1.15 The distance from Earth to the Moon may seem immense, but it is just a tiny fraction of the distances from Earth to other
celestial bodies. (credit: NASA)

The range of objects and phenomena studied in physics is immense. From the incredibly short lifetime of a nucleus
to the age of the Earth, from the tiny sizes of sub-nuclear particles to the vast distance to the edges of the known
universe, from the force exerted by a jumping flea to the force between Earth and the Sun, there are enough factors
of 10 to challenge the imagination of even the most experienced scientist. Giving numerical values for physical
quantities and equations for physical principles allows us to understand nature much more deeply than does
qualitative description alone. To comprehend these vast ranges, we must also have accepted units in which to
16   1 • Introduction: The Nature of Science and Physics



     express them. And we shall find that (even in the potentially mundane discussion of meters, kilograms, and
     seconds) a profound simplicity of nature appears—most physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of
     only four fundamental physical quantities: length, mass, time, and electric current.

     We define a physical quantity either by specifying how it is measured or by stating how it is calculated from other
     measurements. For example, we define distance and time by specifying methods for measuring them, whereas we
     define average speed by stating that it is calculated as distance traveled divided by time of travel.

     Measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units, which are standardized values. For example,
     the length of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in units of meters (for sprinters) or kilometers
     (for distance runners). Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and
     compare measured values in a meaningful way. (See Figure 1.16.)




                                       FIGURE 1.16 Distances given in unknown units are maddeningly useless.

     There are two major systems of units used in the world: SI units (also known as the metric system) and English
     units (also known as the customary or imperial system). English units were historically used in nations once ruled
     by the British Empire and are still widely used in the United States. Virtually every other country in the world now
     uses SI units as the standard; the metric system is also the standard system agreed upon by scientists and
     mathematicians. The acronym “SI” is derived from the French Système International.

     SI Units: Fundamental and Derived Units
     Table 1.1 gives the fundamental SI units that are used throughout this textbook. This text uses non-SI units in a few
     applications where they are in very common use, such as the measurement of blood pressure in millimeters of
     mercury (mm Hg). Whenever non-SI units are discussed, they will be tied to SI units through conversions.

                                         Length            Mass             Time        Electric Current

                                   TABLE 1.1 Fundamental SI Units

     It is an intriguing fact that some physical quantities are more fundamental than others and that the most
     fundamental physical quantities can be defined only in terms of the procedure used to measure them. The units in
     which they are measured are thus called fundamental units. In this textbook, the fundamental physical quantities
     are taken to be length, mass, time, and electric current. (Note that electric current will not be introduced until much
     later in this text.) All other physical quantities, such as force and electric charge, can be expressed as algebraic
     combinations of length, mass, time, and current (for example, speed is length divided by time); these units are
     called derived units.

Units of Time, Length, and Mass: The Second, Meter, and Kilogram
The Second
The SI unit for time, the second (abbreviated s), has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of a
mean solar day. More recently, a new standard was adopted to gain greater accuracy and to define the second in
terms of a non-varying, or constant, physical phenomenon (because the solar day is getting longer due to very
gradual slowing of the Earth’s rotation). Cesium atoms can be made to vibrate in a very steady way, and these
vibrations can be readily observed and counted. In 1967 the second was redefined as the time required for
9,192,631,770 of these vibrations. (See Figure 1.17.) Accuracy in the fundamental units is essential, because all
measurements are ultimately expressed in terms of fundamental units and can be no more accurate than are the
fundamental units themselves.




FIGURE 1.17 An atomic clock such as this one uses the vibrations of cesium atoms to keep time to a precision of better than a microsecond
per year. The fundamental unit of time, the second, is based on such clocks. This image is looking down from the top of an atomic fountain
nearly 30 feet tall! (credit: Steve Jurvetson/Flickr)

The Meter
The SI unit for length is the meter (abbreviated m); its definition has also changed over time to become more
accurate and precise. The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the
North Pole. This measurement was improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two
engraved lines on a platinum-iridium bar now kept near Paris. By 1960, it had become possible to define the meter
even more accurately in terms of the wavelength of light, so it was again redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of
orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its present definition (partly for greater
accuracy) as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. (See Figure 1.18.) This change
defines the speed of light to be exactly 299,792,458 meters per second. The length of the meter will change if the
speed of light is someday measured with greater accuracy.




FIGURE 1.18 The meter is defined to be the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second in a vacuum. Distance traveled is speed
multiplied by time.

The Kilogram
The SI unit for mass is the kilogram (abbreviated kg); it was previously defined to be the mass of a platinum-iridium
cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. Exact
replicas of the previously defined kilogram are also kept at the United States’ National Institute of Standards and
Technology, or NIST, located in Gaithersburg, Maryland outside of Washington D.C., and at other locations around
the world. The determination of all other masses could be ultimately traced to a comparison with the standard
mass. Even though the platinum-iridium cylinder was resistant to corrosion, airborne contaminants were able to
adhere to its surface, slightly changing its mass over time. In May 2019, the scientific community adopted a more

     stable definition of the kilogram. The kilogram is now defined in terms of the second, the meter, and Planck's
     constant, h (a quantum mechanical value that relates a photon's energy to its frequency).

     Electric current and its accompanying unit, the ampere, will be introduced in Introduction to Electric Current,
     Resistance, and Ohm's Law when electricity and magnetism are covered. The initial modules in this textbook are
     concerned with mechanics, fluids, heat, and waves. In these subjects all pertinent physical quantities can be
     expressed in terms of the fundamental units of length, mass, and time.

     Metric Prefixes
     SI units are part of the metric system. The metric system is convenient for scientific and engineering calculations
     because the units are categorized by factors of 10. Table 1.2 gives metric prefixes and symbols used to denote
     various factors of 10.

     Metric systems have the advantage that conversions of units involve only powers of 10. There are 100 centimeters
     in a meter, 1000 meters in a kilometer, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as the system of U.S. customary units,
     the relationships are not as simple—there are 12 inches in a foot, 5280 feet in a mile, and so on. Another advantage
     of the metric system is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by using an
     appropriate metric prefix. For example, distances in meters are suitable in construction, while distances in
     kilometers are appropriate for air travel, and the tiny measure of nanometers are convenient in optical design. With
     the metric system there is no need to invent new units for particular applications.

     The term order of magnitude refers to the scale of a value expressed in the metric system. Each power of , and
     so forth are all different orders of magnitude. All quantities that can be expressed as a product of a specific power of
        are said to be of the same order of magnitude. For example, the number           can be written as         , and the
     number        can be written as             Thus, the numbers        and      are of the same order of magnitude:
     Order of magnitude can be thought of as a ballpark estimate for the scale of a value. The diameter of an atom is on
     the order of             while the diameter of the Sun is on the order of


       The Quest for Microscopic Standards for Basic Units
       The fundamental units described in this chapter are those that produce the greatest accuracy and precision in
       measurement. There is a sense among physicists that, because there is an underlying microscopic substructure
       to matter, it would be most satisfying to base our standards of measurement on microscopic objects and
       fundamental physical phenomena such as the speed of light. A microscopic standard has been accomplished for
       the standard of time, which is based on the oscillations of the cesium atom.

       The standard for length was once based on the wavelength of light (a small-scale length) emitted by a certain
       type of atom, but it has been supplanted by the more precise measurement of the speed of light. If it becomes
       possible to measure the mass of atoms or a particular arrangement of atoms such as a silicon sphere to greater
       precision than the kilogram standard, it may become possible to base mass measurements on the small scale.
       There are also possibilities that electrical phenomena on the small scale may someday allow us to base a unit of
       charge on the charge of electrons and protons, but at present current and charge are related to large-scale
       currents and forces between wires.

Known Ranges of Length, Mass, and Time
The vastness of the universe and the breadth over which physics applies are illustrated by the wide range of
examples of known lengths, masses, and times in Table 1.3. Examination of this table will give you some feeling for
the range of possible topics and numerical values. (See Figure 1.19 and Figure 1.20.)

     Unit Conversion and Dimensional Analysis
     It is often necessary to convert from one type of unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European
     cookbook, some quantities may be expressed in units of liters and you need to convert them to cups. Or, perhaps
     you are reading walking directions from one location to another and you are interested in how many miles you will
     be walking. In this case, you will need to convert units of feet to miles.

     Let us consider a simple example of how to convert units. Let us say that we want to convert 80 meters (m) to
     kilometers (km).

     The first thing to do is to list the units that you have and the units that you want to convert to. In this case, we have
     units in meters and we want to convert to kilometers.

     Next, we need to determine a conversion factor relating meters to kilometers. A conversion factor is a ratio
     expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit. For example, there are 12 inches in 1 foot, 100
     centimeters in 1 meter, 60 seconds in 1 minute, and so on. In this case, we know that there are 1,000 meters in 1
     kilometer.

     Now we can set up our unit conversion. We will write the units that we have and then multiply them by the
     conversion factor so that the units cancel out, as shown:

                                                                                                                                      1.1

     Note that the unwanted m unit cancels, leaving only the desired km unit. You can use this method to convert
     between any types of unit.

             EXAMPLE 1.1

     Unit Conversions: A Short Drive Home
     Suppose that you drive the 10.0 km from your school to home in 20.0 min. Calculate your average speed (a) in
     kilometers per hour (km/h) and (b) in meters per second (m/s). (Note: Average speed is distance traveled divided by
     time of travel.)

     Strategy

     First we calculate the average speed using the given units. Then we can get the average speed into the desired units
     by picking the correct conversion factor and multiplying by it. The correct conversion factor is the one that cancels
     the unwanted unit and leaves the desired unit in its place.

     Solution for (a)

     (1) Calculate average speed. Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel. (Take this definition as a
     given for now—average speed and other motion concepts will be covered in a later module.) In equation form,

                                                                                                                       1.2

     (2) Substitute the given values for distance and time.

                                                                                                                       1.3

     (3) Convert km/min to km/h: multiply by the conversion factor that will cancel minutes and leave hours. That
     conversion factor is

     Discussion for (a)

     To check your answer, consider the following:

     (1) Be sure that you have properly cancelled the units in the unit conversion. If you have written the unit conversion
     factor upside down, the units will not cancel properly in the equation. If you accidentally get the ratio upside down,
     then the units will not cancel; rather, they will give you the wrong units as follows:

                                                                                                                       1.4

     which are obviously not the desired units of km/h.

     (2) Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked us to solve for average speed in
     units of km/h and we have indeed obtained these units.

     (3) Check the significant figures. Because each of the values given in the problem has three significant figures, the
     answer should also have three significant figures. The answer 30.0 km/hr does indeed have three significant figures,
     so this is appropriate. Note that the significant figures in the conversion factor are not relevant because an hour is
     defined to be 60 minutes, so the precision of the conversion factor is perfect.

     (4) Next, check whether the answer is reasonable. Let us consider some information from the problem—if you travel
     10 km in a third of an hour (20 min), you would travel three times that far in an hour. The answer does seem
     reasonable.

     Solution for (b)

     There are several ways to convert the average speed into meters per second.

     (1) Start with the answer to (a) and convert km/h to m/s. Two conversion factors are needed—one to convert hours
     to seconds, and another to convert kilometers to meters.

     (2) Multiplying by these yields

If we had started with 0.500 km/min, we would have needed different conversion factors, but the answer would
have been the same: 8.33 m/s.

You may have noted that the answers in the worked example just covered were given to three digits. Why? When do
you need to be concerned about the number of digits in something you calculate? Why not write down all the digits
your calculator produces? The module Accuracy, Precision, and Significant Figures will help you answer these
questions.



  Nonstandard Units
  While there are numerous types of units that we are all familiar with, there are others that are much more
  obscure. For example, a firkin is a unit of volume that was once used to measure beer. One firkin equals about
  34 liters. To learn more about nonstandard units, use a dictionary or encyclopedia to research different “weights
  and measures.” Take note of any unusual units, such as a barleycorn, that are not listed in the text. Think about
  how the unit is defined and state its relationship to SI units.


    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Some hummingbirds beat their wings more than 50 times per second. A scientist is measuring the time it takes for a
hummingbird to beat its wings once. Which fundamental unit should the scientist use to describe the measurement?
Which factor of 10 is the scientist likely to use to describe the motion precisely? Identify the metric prefix that
corresponds to this factor of 10.
Solution
The scientist will measure the time between each movement using the fundamental unit of seconds. Because the
wings beat so fast, the scientist will probably need to measure in milliseconds, or seconds. (50 beats per
second corresponds to 20 milliseconds per beat.)


    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
One cubic centimeter is equal to one milliliter. What does this tell you about the different units in the SI metric
system?
Solution
The fundamental unit of length (meter) is probably used to create the derived unit of volume (liter). The measure of
a milliliter is dependent on the measure of a centimeter.


1.3 Accuracy, Precision, and Significant Figures
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Determine the appropriate number of significant figures in both addition and subtraction, as well as
    multiplication and division calculations.
 • Calculate the percent uncertainty of a measurement.
24   1 • Introduction: The Nature of Science and Physics




     FIGURE 1.21 A double-pan mechanical balance is used to compare different masses. Usually an object with unknown mass is placed in one
     pan and objects of known mass are placed in the other pan. When the bar that connects the two pans is horizontal, then the masses in both
     pans are equal. The “known masses” are typically metal cylinders of standard mass such as 1 gram, 10 grams, and 100 grams. (credit:
     Serge Melki)




     FIGURE 1.22 Many mechanical balances, such as double-pan balances, have been replaced by digital scales, which can typically measure
     the mass of an object more precisely. Whereas a mechanical balance may only read the mass of an object to the nearest tenth of a gram,
     many digital scales can measure the mass of an object up to the nearest thousandth of a gram. (credit: Karel Jakubec)

     Accuracy and Precision of a Measurement
     Science is based on observation and experiment—that is, on measurements. Accuracy is how close a measurement
     is to the correct value for that measurement. For example, let us say that you are measuring the length of standard
     computer paper. The packaging in which you purchased the paper states that it is 11.0 inches long. You measure the
     length of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9 in. These
     measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of 11.0 inches. In contrast, if you
     had obtained a measurement of 12 inches, your measurement would not be very accurate.

     The precision of a measurement system refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements
     (which are repeated under the same conditions). Consider the example of the paper measurements. The precision
     of the measurements refers to the spread of the measured values. One way to analyze the precision of the
     measurements would be to determine the range, or difference, between the lowest and the highest measured
     values. In that case, the lowest value was 10.9 in. and the highest value was 11.2 in. Thus, the measured values
     deviated from each other by at most 0.3 in. These measurements were relatively precise because they did not vary
     too much in value. However, if the measured values had been 10.9, 11.1, and 11.9, then the measurements would
     not be very precise because there would be significant variation from one measurement to another.

     The measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are
     accurate but not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let us consider an example of a GPS system that is
     attempting to locate the position of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of
     a bull’s-eye target, and think of each GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot. In Figure 1.23, you can see

                                                                                         1.3 • Accuracy, Precision, and Significant Figures      25



that the GPS measurements are spread out far apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the actual
location of the restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low precision, high accuracy measuring system.
However, in Figure 1.24, the GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far
away from the target location. This indicates a high precision, low accuracy measuring system.

pinpoint the location of the restaurant. The dots are spread out quite far apart from one another, indicating low precision, but they are each
rather close to the actual location of the restaurant, indicating high accuracy. (credit: Dark Evil)

from the actual location of the restaurant, indicating low accuracy. (credit: Dark Evil)

Accuracy, Precision, and Uncertainty
The degree of accuracy and precision of a measuring system are related to the uncertainty in the measurements.
Uncertainty is a quantitative measure of how much your measured values deviate from a standard or expected
value. If your measurements are not very accurate or precise, then the uncertainty of your values will be very high.
In more general terms, uncertainty can be thought of as a disclaimer for your measured values. For example, if
someone asked you to provide the mileage on your car, you might say that it is 45,000 miles, plus or minus 500
miles. The plus or minus amount is the uncertainty in your value. That is, you are indicating that the actual mileage
of your car might be as low as 44,500 miles or as high as 45,500 miles, or anywhere in between. All measurements
contain some amount of uncertainty. In our example of measuring the length of the paper, we might say that the
length of the paper is 11 in., plus or minus 0.2 in. The uncertainty in a measurement, , is often denoted as
(“delta ”), so the measurement result would be recorded as                . In our paper example, the length of the paper
could be expressed as

The factors contributing to uncertainty in a measurement include:

1.   Limitations of the measuring device,
2.   The skill of the person making the measurement,
3.   Irregularities in the object being measured,
4.   Any other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation).

In our example, such factors contributing to the uncertainty could be the following: the smallest division on the ruler
is 0.1 in., the person using the ruler has bad eyesight, or one side of the paper is slightly longer than the other. At
any rate, the uncertainty in a measurement must be based on a careful consideration of all the factors that might
contribute and their possible effects.
26   1 • Introduction: The Nature of Science and Physics




       Making Connections: Real-World Connections – Fevers or Chills?
       Uncertainty is a critical piece of information, both in physics and in many other real-world applications. Imagine
       you are caring for a sick child. You suspect the child has a fever, so you check their temperature with a
       thermometer. What if the uncertainty of the thermometer were             ? If the child’s temperature reading was
              (which is normal body temperature), the “true” temperature could be anywhere from a hypothermic
              to a dangerously high            . A thermometer with an uncertainty of          would be useless.


     Percent Uncertainty
     One method of expressing uncertainty is as a percent of the measured value. If a measurement            is expressed with
     uncertainty,  , the percent uncertainty (%unc) is defined to be

                                                                                                                           1.7


             EXAMPLE 1.2

     Calculating Percent Uncertainty: A Bag of Apples
     A grocery store sells    bags of apples. You purchase four bags over the course of a month and weigh the apples
     each time. You obtain the following measurements:

      •   Week 1 weight:
      •   Week 2 weight:
      •   Week 3 weight:
      •   Week 4 weight:

     You determine that the weight of the          bag has an uncertainty of       . What is the percent uncertainty of the
     bag’s weight?

     Strategy

     First, observe that the expected value of the bag’s weight, , is 5 lb. The uncertainty in this value,     , is 0.4 lb. We
     can use the following equation to determine the percent uncertainty of the weight:

                                                                                                                           1.8

     Solution

     Plug the known values into the equation:

                                                                                                                           1.9

     Discussion

     We can conclude that the weight of the apple bag is              . Consider how this percent uncertainty would change
     if the bag of apples were half as heavy, but the uncertainty in the weight remained the same. Hint for future
     calculations: when calculating percent uncertainty, always remember that you must multiply the fraction by 100%.
     If you do not do this, you will have a decimal quantity, not a percent value.


     Uncertainties in Calculations
     There is an uncertainty in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated
     from measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the length and width have uncertainties.
     How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements going into
     the calculation have small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the method of adding percents can be used
     for multiplication or division. This method says that the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication



     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                            1.3 • Accuracy, Precision, and Significant Figures   27



or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation. For example, if a floor
has a length of          and a width of         , with uncertainties of    and   , respectively, then the area of the
floor is          and has an uncertainty of      . (Expressed as an area this is       , which we round to
since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a square meter.)

    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
A high school track coach has just purchased a new stopwatch. The stopwatch manual states that the stopwatch
has an uncertainty of ±0.05 s. The team's top sprinter clocked a 100 meter sprint at 12.04 seconds last week and at
11.96 seconds this week. Can we conclude that this week's time was faster?
Solution
No, the uncertainty in the stopwatch is too great to effectively differentiate between the sprint times.


Precision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures
An important factor in the accuracy and precision of measurements involves the precision of the measuring tool. In
general, a precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, a standard
ruler can measure length to the nearest millimeter, while a caliper can measure length to the nearest 0.01
millimeter. The caliper is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences in
length. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise and accurate the measurements can be.

When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we initially measured with our measuring tool.
For example, if you use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, you may measure it to be                 . You
could not express this value as              because your measuring tool was not precise enough to measure a
hundredth of a centimeter. It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some
way by the person performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a
ruler notices that the stick length seems to be somewhere in between                 and           , and they must
estimate the value of the last digit. Using the method of significant figures, the rule is that the last digit written
down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty. In order to determine the number of significant
digits in a value, start with the first measured value at the left and count the number of digits through the last digit
written on the right. For example, the measured value               has three digits, or significant figures. Significant
figures indicate the precision of a measuring tool that was used to measure a value.

Zeros
Special consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. The zeros in 0.053 are not significant,
because they are only placekeepers that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053. The
zeros in 10.053 are not placekeepers but are significant—this number has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300
may or may not be significant depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to
the last digit, or they could be placekeepers. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. (To avoid this
ambiguity, write 1300 in scientific notation.) Zeros are significant except when they serve only as placekeepers.

    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Determine the number of significant figures in the following measurements:
a. 0.0009
b. 15,450.0
 c.
d. 87.990
e. 30.42

Solution
(a) 1; the zeros in this number are placekeepers that indicate the decimal point

(b) 6; here, the zeros indicate that a measurement was made to the 0.1 decimal point, so the zeros are significant

(c) 1; the value    signifies the decimal place, not the number of measured values
28   1 • Introduction: The Nature of Science and Physics



     (d) 5; the final zero indicates that a measurement was made to the 0.001 decimal point, so it is significant

     (e) 4; any zeros located in between significant figures in a number are also significant


     Significant Figures in Calculations
     When combining measurements with different degrees of accuracy and precision, the number of significant digits in
     the final answer can be no greater than the number of significant digits in the least precise measured value. There
     are two different rules, one for multiplication and division and the other for addition and subtraction, as discussed
     below.

     1. For multiplication and division: The result should have the same number of significant figures as the quantity
     having the least significant figures entering into the calculation. For example, the area of a circle can be calculated
     from its radius using           . Let us see how many significant figures the area has if the radius has only two—say,
                . Then,

                                                                                                                         1.10

     is what you would get using a calculator that has an eight-digit output. But because the radius has only two
     significant figures, it limits the calculated quantity to two significant figures or

                                                                                                                         1.11

     even though     is good to at least eight digits.

     2. For addition and subtraction: The answer can contain no more decimal places than the least precise
     measurement. Suppose that you buy 7.56-kg of potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale with precision
     0.01 kg. Then you drop off 6.052-kg of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with precision 0.001 kg.
     Finally, you go home and add 13.7 kg of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with precision 0.1 kg. How many
     kilograms of potatoes do you now have, and how many significant figures are appropriate in the answer? The mass is
     found by simple addition and subtraction:



                                                                                                                         1.12



     Next, we identify the least precise measurement: 13.7 kg. This measurement is expressed to the 0.1 decimal place,
     so our final answer must also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus, the answer is rounded to the tenths
     place, giving us 15.2 kg.

     Significant Figures in this Text
     In this text, most numbers are assumed to have three significant figures. Furthermore, consistent numbers of
     significant figures are used in all worked examples. You will note that an answer given to three digits is based on
     input good to at least three digits, for example. If the input has fewer significant figures, the answer will also have
     fewer significant figures. Care is also taken that the number of significant figures is reasonable for the situation
     posed. In some topics, particularly in optics, more accurate numbers are needed and more than three significant
     figures will be used. Finally, if a number is exact, such as the two in the formula for the circumference of a circle,
              , it does not affect the number of significant figures in a calculation.

Solution
(a) 37.2 pounds; Because the number of bags is an exact value, it is not considered in the significant figures.

figures.


1.4 Approximation
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Make reasonable approximations based on given data.

On many occasions, physicists, other scientists, and engineers need to make approximations or “guesstimates” for
a particular quantity. What is the distance to a certain destination? What is the approximate density of a given item?
About how large a current will there be in a circuit? Many approximate numbers are based on formulae in which the
input quantities are known only to a limited accuracy. As you develop problem-solving skills (that can be applied to a
variety of fields through a study of physics), you will also develop skills at approximating. You will develop these
skills through thinking more quantitatively, and by being willing to take risks. As with any endeavor, experience
helps, as well as familiarity with units. These approximations allow us to rule out certain scenarios or unrealistic
numbers. Approximations also allow us to challenge others and guide us in our approaches to our scientific world.
Let us do two examples to illustrate this concept.


       EXAMPLE 1.3

Approximate the Height of a Building
Can you approximate the height of one of the buildings on your campus, or in your neighborhood? Let us make an
approximation based upon the height of a person. In this example, we will calculate the height of a 39-story
building.

Strategy

Think about the average height of an adult male. We can approximate the height of the building by scaling up from
the height of a person.

Solution

Based on information in the example, we know there are 39 stories in the building. If we use the fact that the height
of one story is approximately equal to about the length of two adult humans (each human is about 2-m tall), then we
can estimate the total height of the building to be

                                                                                                                  1.13

Discussion

You can use known quantities to determine an approximate measurement of unknown quantities. If your hand
measures 10 cm across, how many hand lengths equal the width of your desk? What other measurements can you
approximate besides length?
30   1 • Introduction: The Nature of Science and Physics




             EXAMPLE 1.4

     Approximating Vast Numbers: a Trillion Dollars




     FIGURE 1.25 A bank stack contains one-hundred $100 bills, and is worth $10,000. How many bank stacks make up a trillion dollars?
     (credit: Andrew Magill)

     The U.S. federal debt in 2021 was a little more than $28 trillion. Most of us do not have any concept of how much
     even one trillion actually is. Suppose that you were given a trillion dollars in $100 bills. If you made 100-bill stacks
     and used them to evenly cover a football field (between the end zones), make an approximation of how high the
     money pile would become. (We will use feet/inches rather than meters here because football fields are measured in
     yards.) One of your friends says 3 in., while another says 10 ft. What do you think?

     Strategy

     When you imagine the situation, you probably envision thousands of small stacks of 100 wrapped $100 bills, such
     as you might see in movies or at a bank. Since this is an easy-to-approximate quantity, let us start there. We can find
     the volume of a stack of 100 bills, find out how many stacks make up one trillion dollars, and then set this volume
     equal to the area of the football field multiplied by the unknown height.

     Solution

     (1) Calculate the volume of a stack of 100 bills. The dimensions of a single bill are approximately 3 in. by 6 in. A
     stack of 100 of these is about 0.5 in. thick. So the total volume of a stack of 100 bills is:


                                                                                                                                    1.14


     (2) Calculate the number of stacks. Note that a trillion dollars is equal to        and a stack of one-hundred
           bills is equal to        or          . The number of stacks you will have is:

                                                                                                                                    1.15

     (3) Calculate the area of a football field in square inches. The area of a football field is                         which gives
                 Because we are working in inches, we need to convert square yards to square inches:

Discussion

The final approximate value is much higher than the early estimate of 3 in., but the other early estimate of 10 ft (120
in.) was roughly correct. How did the approximation measure up to your first guess? What can this exercise tell you
in terms of rough “guesstimates” versus carefully calculated approximations?


    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Using mental math and your understanding of fundamental units, approximate the area of a regulation basketball
court. Describe the process you used to arrive at your final approximation.
Solution
An average male is about two meters tall. It would take approximately 15 males laid out end to end to cover the
length, and about 7 to cover the width. That gives an approximate area of       .

INTRODUCTION TO ONE-DIMENSIONAL KINEMATICS Objects are in motion everywhere we look. Everything
from a tennis game to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you are resting, your heart
moves blood through your veins. And even in inanimate objects, there is continuous motion in the vibrations of
atoms and molecules. Questions about motion are interesting in and of themselves: How long will it take for a space
probe to get to Mars? Where will a football land if it is thrown at a certain angle? But an understanding of motion is
also key to understanding other concepts in physics. An understanding of acceleration, for example, is crucial to the
study of force.

Our formal study of physics begins with kinematics which is defined as the study of motion without considering its
causes. The word “kinematics” comes from a Greek term meaning motion and is related to other English words such
as “cinema” (movies) and “kinesiology” (the study of human motion). In one-dimensional kinematics and Two-
Dimensional Kinematics we will study only the motion of a football, for example, without worrying about what forces
cause or change its motion. Such considerations come in other chapters. In this chapter, we examine the simplest
38   2 • Kinematics



     type of motion—namely, motion along a straight line, or one-dimensional motion. In Two-Dimensional Kinematics,
     we apply concepts developed here to study motion along curved paths (two- and three-dimensional motion); for
     example, that of a car rounding a curve.

     2.1 Displacement
     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      • Define position, displacement, distance, and distance traveled.
      • Explain the relationship between position and displacement.
      • Distinguish between displacement and distance traveled.
      • Calculate displacement and distance given initial position, final position, and the path between the two.




     FIGURE 2.2 These cyclists in Vietnam can be described by their position relative to buildings and a canal. Their motion can be described by
     their change in position, or displacement, in the frame of reference. (credit: Suzan Black, Fotopedia)

     Position
     In order to describe the motion of an object, you must first be able to describe its position—where it is at any
     particular time. More precisely, you need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame. Earth is
     often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects in
     that reference frame. For example, a rocket launch would be described in terms of the position of the rocket with
     respect to the Earth as a whole, while a professor’s position could be described in terms of where she is in relation
     to the nearby white board. (See Figure 2.3.) In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are
     in motion relative to the Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane,
     not the Earth, as the reference frame. (See Figure 2.4.)

     Displacement
     If an object moves relative to a reference frame (for example, if a professor moves to the right relative to a white
     board or a passenger moves toward the rear of an airplane), then the object’s position changes. This change in
     position is known as displacement. The word “displacement” implies that an object has moved, or has been
     displaced.


       Displacement
       Displacement is the change in position of an object:
                                                                                                                                        2.1
       where        is displacement,        is the final position, and       is the initial position.

In this text the upper case Greek letter (delta) always means “change in” whatever quantity follows it; thus,
means change in position. Always solve for displacement by subtracting initial position from final position .

Note that the SI unit for displacement is the meter (m) (see Physical Quantities and Units), but sometimes
kilometers, miles, feet, and other units of length are used. Keep in mind that when units other than the meter are
used in a problem, you may need to convert them into meters to complete the calculation.




FIGURE 2.3 A professor paces left and right while lecturing. Her position relative to Earth is given by . The      displacement of the
professor relative to Earth is represented by an arrow pointing to the right.




FIGURE 2.4 A passenger moves from his seat to the back of the plane. His location relative to the airplane is given by . The
displacement of the passenger relative to the plane is represented by an arrow toward the rear of the plane. Notice that the arrow
representing his displacement is twice as long as the arrow representing the displacement of the professor (he moves twice as far) in Figure
2.3.

Note that displacement has a direction as well as a magnitude. The professor’s displacement is 2.0 m to the right,
and the airline passenger’s displacement is 4.0 m toward the rear. In one-dimensional motion, direction can be
specified with a plus or minus sign. When you begin a problem, you should select which direction is positive (usually
that will be to the right or up, but you are free to select positive as being any direction). The professor’s initial
position is               and her final position is            . Thus her displacement is
                                                                                                                                      2.2
40   2 • Kinematics



     In this coordinate system, motion to the right is positive, whereas motion to the left is negative. Similarly, the
     airplane passenger’s initial position is            and his final position is            , so his displacement is
                                                                                                                          2.3
     His displacement is negative because his motion is toward the rear of the plane, or in the negative     direction in our
     coordinate system.

     Distance
     Although displacement is described in terms of direction, distance is not. Distance is defined to be the magnitude or
     size of displacement between two positions. Note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the
     distance traveled between them. Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions.
     Distance has no direction and, thus, no sign. For example, the distance the professor walks is 2.0 m. The distance
     the airplane passenger walks is 4.0 m.


       Misconception Alert: Distance Traveled vs. Magnitude of Displacement
       It is important to note that the distance traveled, however, can be greater than the magnitude of the
       displacement (by magnitude, we mean just the size of the displacement without regard to its direction; that is,
       just a number with a unit). For example, the professor could pace back and forth many times, perhaps walking a
       distance of 150 m during a lecture, yet still end up only 2.0 m to the right of her starting point. In this case her
       displacement would be +2.0 m, the magnitude of her displacement would be 2.0 m, but the distance she
       traveled would be 150 m. In kinematics we nearly always deal with displacement and magnitude of
       displacement, and almost never with distance traveled. One way to think about this is to assume you marked the
       start of the motion and the end of the motion. The displacement is simply the difference in the position of the
       two marks and is independent of the path taken in traveling between the two marks. The distance traveled,
       however, is the total length of the path taken between the two marks.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      • Define and distinguish between scalar and vector quantities.
      • Assign a coordinate system for a scenario involving one-dimensional motion.

FIGURE 2.6 The motion of this Eclipse Concept jet can be described in terms of the distance it has traveled (a scalar quantity) or its
displacement in a specific direction (a vector quantity). In order to specify the direction of motion, its displacement must be described
based on a coordinate system. In this case, it may be convenient to choose motion toward the left as positive motion (it is the forward
direction for the plane), although in many cases, the -coordinate runs from left to right, with motion to the right as positive and motion to
the left as negative. (credit: Armchair Aviator, Flickr)

What is the difference between distance and displacement? Whereas displacement is defined by both direction and
magnitude, distance is defined only by magnitude. Displacement is an example of a vector quantity. Distance is an
example of a scalar quantity. A vector is any quantity with both magnitude and direction. Other examples of vectors
include a velocity of 90 km/h east and a force of 500 newtons straight down.

The direction of a vector in one-dimensional motion is given simply by a plus     or minus       sign. Vectors are
represented graphically by arrows. An arrow used to represent a vector has a length proportional to the vector’s
magnitude (e.g., the larger the magnitude, the longer the length of the vector) and points in the same direction as
the vector.

Some physical quantities, like distance, either have no direction or none is specified. A scalar is any quantity that
has a magnitude, but no direction. For example, a        temperature, the 250 kilocalories (250 Calories) of energy in
a candy bar, a 90 km/h speed limit, a person’s 1.8 m height, and a distance of 2.0 m are all scalars—quantities with
no specified direction. Note, however, that a scalar can be negative, such as a         temperature. In this case, the
minus sign indicates a point on a scale rather than a direction. Scalars are never represented by arrows.

Coordinate Systems for One-Dimensional Motion
In order to describe the direction of a vector quantity, you must designate a coordinate system within the reference
frame. For one-dimensional motion, this is a simple coordinate system consisting of a one-dimensional coordinate
line. In general, when describing horizontal motion, motion to the right is usually considered positive, and motion to
the left is considered negative. With vertical motion, motion up is usually positive and motion down is negative. In
some cases, however, as with the jet in Figure 2.6, it can be more convenient to switch the positive and negative
directions. For example, if you are analyzing the motion of falling objects, it can be useful to define downwards as
the positive direction. If people in a race are running to the left, it is useful to define left as the positive direction. It
does not matter as long as the system is clear and consistent. Once you assign a positive direction and start solving
a problem, you cannot change it.

     FIGURE 2.7 It is usually convenient to consider motion upward or to the right as positive      and motion downward or to the left as
     negative   .

          CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
     A person’s speed can stay the same as they round a corner and changes direction. Given this information, is speed a
     scalar or a vector quantity? Explain.
     Solution
     Speed is a scalar quantity. It does not change at all with direction changes; therefore, it has magnitude only. If it
     were a vector quantity, it would change as direction changes (even if its magnitude remained constant).


     2.3 Time, Velocity, and Speed
     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      • Explain the relationships between instantaneous velocity, average velocity, instantaneous speed, average
         speed, displacement, and time.
      • Calculate velocity and speed given initial position, initial time, final position, and final time.
      • Derive a graph of velocity vs. time given a graph of position vs. time.
      • Interpret a graph of velocity vs. time.

     There is more to motion than distance and displacement. Questions such as, “How long does a foot race take?” and
     “What was the runner’s speed?” cannot be answered without an understanding of other concepts. In this section
     we add definitions of time, velocity, and speed to expand our description of motion.

     Time
     As discussed in Physical Quantities and Units, the most fundamental physical quantities are defined by how they are
     measured. This is the case with time. Every measurement of time involves measuring a change in some physical
     quantity. It may be a number on a digital clock, a heartbeat, or the position of the Sun in the sky. In physics, the
     definition of time is simple—time is change, or the interval over which change occurs. It is impossible to know that

time has passed unless something changes.

The amount of time or change is calibrated by comparison with a standard. The SI unit for time is the second,
abbreviated s. We might, for example, observe that a certain pendulum makes one full swing every 0.75 s. We could
then use the pendulum to measure time by counting its swings or, of course, by connecting the pendulum to a clock
mechanism that registers time on a dial. This allows us to not only measure the amount of time, but also to
determine a sequence of events.

How does time relate to motion? We are usually interested in elapsed time for a particular motion, such as how long
it takes an airplane passenger to get from his seat to the back of the plane. To find elapsed time, we note the time at
the beginning and end of the motion and subtract the two. For example, a lecture may start at 11:00 A.M. and end at
11:50 A.M., so that the elapsed time would be 50 min. Elapsed time         is the difference between the ending time
and beginning time,
                                                                                                                    2.4
where    is the change in time or elapsed time, is the time at the end of the motion, and is the time at the
beginning of the motion. (As usual, the delta symbol, , means the change in the quantity that follows it.)

Life is simpler if the beginning time is taken to be zero, as when we use a stopwatch. If we were using a
stopwatch, it would simply read zero at the start of the lecture and 50 min at the end. If    , then                 .

In this text, for simplicity’s sake,

 • motion starts at time equal to zero
 • the symbol is used for elapsed time unless otherwise specified

Velocity
Your notion of velocity is probably the same as its scientific definition. You know that if you have a large
displacement in a small amount of time you have a large velocity, and that velocity has units of distance divided by
time, such as miles per hour or kilometers per hour.


  Average Velocity
  Average velocity is displacement (change in position) divided by the time of travel,

                                                                                                                  2.5

  where is the average (indicated by the bar over the ) velocity,   is the change in position (or displacement),
  and    and     are the final and beginning positions at times and , respectively. If the starting time is
  taken to be zero, then the average velocity is simply

                                                                                                                  2.6



Notice that this definition indicates that velocity is a vector because displacement is a vector. It has both magnitude
and direction. The SI unit for velocity is meters per second or m/s, but many other units, such as km/h, mi/h (also
written as mph), and cm/s, are in common use. Suppose, for example, an airplane passenger took 5 seconds to
move −4 m (the negative sign indicates that displacement is toward the back of the plane). His average velocity
would be

                                                                                                                    2.7

The minus sign indicates the average velocity is also toward the rear of the plane.

The average velocity of an object does not tell us anything about what happens to it between the starting point and
ending point, however. For example, we cannot tell from average velocity whether the airplane passenger stops
momentarily or backs up before he goes to the back of the plane. To get more details, we must consider smaller
44   2 • Kinematics



     segments of the trip over smaller time intervals.




      FIGURE 2.9 A more detailed record of an airplane passenger heading toward the back of the plane, showing smaller segments of his trip.

     The smaller the time intervals considered in a motion, the more detailed the information. When we carry this
     process to its logical conclusion, we are left with an infinitesimally small interval. Over such an interval, the average
     velocity becomes the instantaneous velocity or the velocity at a specific instant. A car’s speedometer, for example,
     shows the magnitude (but not the direction) of the instantaneous velocity of the car. (Police give tickets based on
     instantaneous velocity, but when calculating how long it will take to get from one place to another on a road trip, you
     need to use average velocity.) Instantaneous velocity is the average velocity at a specific instant in time (or over
     an infinitesimally small time interval).

     Mathematically, finding instantaneous velocity, , at a precise instant can involve taking a limit, a calculus
     operation beyond the scope of this text. However, under many circumstances, we can find precise values for
     instantaneous velocity without calculus.

     Speed
     In everyday language, most people use the terms “speed” and “velocity” interchangeably. In physics, however, they
     do not have the same meaning and they are distinct concepts. One major difference is that speed has no direction.
     Thus speed is a scalar. Just as we need to distinguish between instantaneous velocity and average velocity, we also
     need to distinguish between instantaneous speed and average speed.

     Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity. For example, suppose the airplane passenger at
     one instant had an instantaneous velocity of −3.0 m/s (the minus meaning toward the rear of the plane). At that
     same time his instantaneous speed was 3.0 m/s. Or suppose that at one time during a shopping trip your
     instantaneous velocity is 40 km/h due north. Your instantaneous speed at that instant would be 40 km/h—the same
     magnitude but without a direction. Average speed, however, is very different from average velocity. Average speed
     is the distance traveled divided by elapsed time.

     We have noted that distance traveled can be greater than the magnitude of displacement. So average speed can be
     greater than average velocity, which is displacement divided by time. For example, if you drive to a store and return
     home in half an hour, and your car’s odometer shows the total distance traveled was 6 km, then your average speed
     was 12 km/h. Your average velocity, however, was zero, because your displacement for the round trip is zero.
     (Displacement is change in position and, thus, is zero for a round trip.) Thus average speed is not simply the
     magnitude of average velocity.

FIGURE 2.10 During a 30-minute round trip to the store, the total distance traveled is 6 km. The average speed is 12 km/h. The
displacement for the round trip is zero, since there was no net change in position. Thus the average velocity is zero.

Another way of visualizing the motion of an object is to use a graph. A plot of position or of velocity as a function of
time can be very useful. For example, for this trip to the store, the position, velocity, and speed-vs.-time graphs are
displayed in Figure 2.11. (Note that these graphs depict a very simplified model of the trip. We are assuming that
speed is constant during the trip, which is unrealistic given that we’ll probably stop at the store. But for simplicity’s
sake, we will model it with no stops or changes in speed. We are also assuming that the route between the store and
the house is a perfectly straight line.)

       Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Getting a Sense of Speed
       If you have spent much time driving, you probably have a good sense of speeds between about 10 and 70 miles
       per hour. But what are these in meters per second? What do we mean when we say that something is moving at
       10 m/s? To get a better sense of what these values really mean, do some observations and calculations on your
       own:

        • calculate typical car speeds in meters per second
        • estimate jogging and walking speed by timing yourself; convert the measurements into both m/s and mi/h

2.4 Acceleration
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define and distinguish between instantaneous acceleration, average acceleration, and deceleration.
 • Calculate acceleration given initial time, initial velocity, final time, and final velocity.




FIGURE 2.12 A plane decelerates, or slows down, as it comes in for landing in St. Maarten. Its acceleration is opposite in direction to its
velocity. (credit: Steve Conry, Flickr)

In everyday conversation, to accelerate means to speed up. The accelerator in a car can in fact cause it to speed up.
The greater the acceleration, the greater the change in velocity over a given time. The formal definition of
acceleration is consistent with these notions, but more inclusive.


  Average Acceleration
  Average Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes,

                                                                                                                                     2.10

  where      is average acceleration,        is velocity, and is time. (The bar over the           means average acceleration.)


Because acceleration is velocity in m/s divided by time in s, the SI units for acceleration are , meters per
second squared or meters per second per second, which literally means by how many meters per second the
velocity changes every second.
48   2 • Kinematics



     Recall that velocity is a vector—it has both magnitude and direction. This means that a change in velocity can be a
     change in magnitude (or speed), but it can also be a change in direction. For example, if a car turns a corner at
     constant speed, it is accelerating because its direction is changing. The quicker you turn, the greater the
     acceleration. So there is an acceleration when velocity changes either in magnitude (an increase or decrease in
     speed) or in direction, or both.


       Acceleration as a Vector
       Acceleration is a vector in the same direction as the change in velocity,   . Since velocity is a vector, it can
       change either in magnitude or in direction. Acceleration is therefore a change in either speed or direction, or
       both.


     Keep in mind that although acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity, it is not always in the direction of
     motion. When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion. This is known as
     deceleration.




     FIGURE 2.13 A subway train in Sao Paulo, Brazil, decelerates as it comes into a station. It is accelerating in a direction opposite to its
     direction of motion. (credit: Yusuke Kawasaki, Flickr)


       Misconception Alert: Deceleration vs. Negative Acceleration
       Deceleration always refers to acceleration in the direction opposite to the direction of the velocity. Deceleration
       always reduces speed. Negative acceleration, however, is acceleration in the negative direction in the chosen
       coordinate system. Negative acceleration may or may not be deceleration, and deceleration may or may not be
       considered negative acceleration. For example, consider Figure 2.14.

 FIGURE 2.14 (a) This car is speeding up as it moves toward the right. It therefore has positive acceleration in our coordinate system.
 (b) This car is slowing down as it moves toward the right. Therefore, it has negative acceleration in our coordinate system, because its

 This car is moving toward the left, but slowing down over time. Therefore, its acceleration is positive in our coordinate system because
 it is toward the right. However, the car is decelerating because its acceleration is opposite to its motion. (d) This car is speeding up as it

       EXAMPLE 2.1

Calculating Acceleration: A Racehorse Leaves the Gate
A racehorse coming out of the gate accelerates from rest to a velocity of 15.0 m/s due west in 1.80 s. What is its
average acceleration?

     Strategy

     First we draw a sketch and assign a coordinate system to the problem. This is a simple problem, but it always helps
     to visualize it. Notice that we assign east as positive and west as negative. Thus, in this case, we have negative
     velocity.




                                                                  FIGURE 2.16

     We can solve this problem by identifying           and      from the given information and then calculating the average
     acceleration directly from the equation                            .

     Solution

     1. Identify the knowns.           ,                      (the negative sign indicates direction toward the west),
                  .

     2. Find the change in velocity. Since the horse is going from zero to                      , its change in velocity equals its final
     velocity:                        .

     3. Plug in the known values (         and    ) and solve for the unknown .

                                                                                                                                    2.11

     Discussion

     The negative sign for acceleration indicates that acceleration is toward the west. An acceleration of               due
     west means that the horse increases its velocity by 8.33 m/s due west each second, that is, 8.33 meters per second
     per second, which we write as               . This is truly an average acceleration, because the ride is not smooth. We
     shall see later that an acceleration of this magnitude would require the rider to hang on with a force nearly equal to
     his weight.

Instantaneous Acceleration
Instantaneous acceleration , or the acceleration at a specific instant in time, is obtained by the same process as
discussed for instantaneous velocity in Time, Velocity, and Speed—that is, by considering an infinitesimally small
interval of time. How do we find instantaneous acceleration using only algebra? The answer is that we choose an
average acceleration that is representative of the motion. Figure 2.17 shows graphs of instantaneous acceleration
versus time for two very different motions. In Figure 2.17(a), the acceleration varies slightly and the average over
the entire interval is nearly the same as the instantaneous acceleration at any time. In this case, we should treat this
motion as if it had a constant acceleration equal to the average (in this case about            ). In Figure 2.17(b), the
acceleration varies drastically over time. In such situations it is best to consider smaller time intervals and choose
an average acceleration for each. For example, we could consider motion over the time intervals from 0 to 1.0 s and
from 1.0 to 3.0 s as separate motions with accelerations of                 and           , respectively.




FIGURE 2.17 Graphs of instantaneous acceleration versus time for two different one-dimensional motions. (a) Here acceleration varies
only slightly and is always in the same direction, since it is positive. The average over the interval is nearly the same as the acceleration at
any given time. (b) Here the acceleration varies greatly, perhaps representing a package on a post office conveyor belt that is accelerated
forward and backward as it bumps along. It is necessary to consider small time intervals (such as from 0 to 1.0 s) with constant or nearly
constant acceleration in such a situation.

The next several examples consider the motion of the subway train shown in Figure 2.18. In (a) the shuttle moves to
the right, and in (b) it moves to the left. The examples are designed to further illustrate aspects of motion and to
illustrate some of the reasoning that goes into solving problems.

             EXAMPLE 2.2

     Calculating Displacement: A Subway Train
     What are the magnitude and sign of displacements for the motions of the subway train shown in parts (a) and (b) of
     Figure 2.18?

     Strategy

     A drawing with a coordinate system is already provided, so we don’t need to make a sketch, but we should analyze it
     to make sure we understand what it is showing. Pay particular attention to the coordinate system. To find
     displacement, we use the equation                 . This is straightforward since the initial and final positions are
     given.

     Solution

     1. Identify the knowns. In the figure we see that                             and                     for part (a), and
     and                 for part (b).

     2. Solve for displacement in part (a).

     3. Solve for displacement in part (b).
                                                                                                                                             2.13

     Discussion

     The direction of the motion in (a) is to the right and therefore its displacement has a positive sign, whereas motion in
     (b) is to the left and thus has a negative sign.

       EXAMPLE 2.3

Comparing Distance Traveled with Displacement: A Subway Train
What are the distances traveled for the motions shown in parts (a) and (b) of the subway train in Figure 2.18?

Strategy

To answer this question, think about the definitions of distance and distance traveled, and how they are related to
displacement. Distance between two positions is defined to be the magnitude of displacement, which was found in
Example 2.2. Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between the two positions. (See
Displacement.) In the case of the subway train shown in Figure 2.18, the distance traveled is the same as the
distance between the initial and final positions of the train.

Solution

1. The displacement for part (a) was +2.00 km. Therefore, the distance between the initial and final positions was
2.00 km, and the distance traveled was 2.00 km.

2. The displacement for part (b) was         Therefore, the distance between the initial and final positions was
1.50 km, and the distance traveled was 1.50 km.

Discussion

Distance is a scalar. It has magnitude but no sign to indicate direction.

Calculating Acceleration: A Subway Train Speeding Up
Suppose the train in Figure 2.18(a) accelerates from rest to 30.0 km/h in the first 20.0 s of its motion. What is its

Strategy

It is worth it at this point to make a simple sketch:




                                                         FIGURE 2.19

This problem involves three steps. First we must determine the change in velocity, then we must determine the
change in time, and finally we use these values to calculate the acceleration.

Solution

1. Identify the knowns.          (the trains starts at rest),                  , and          .

2. Calculate   . Since the train starts from rest, its change in velocity is                 , where the plus sign
means velocity to the right.

3. Plug in known values and solve for the unknown, .

     4. Since the units are mixed (we have both hours and seconds for time), we need to convert everything into SI units
     of meters and seconds. (See Physical Quantities and Units for more guidance.)

                                                                                                                          2.15


     Discussion

     The plus sign means that acceleration is to the right. This is reasonable because the train starts from rest and ends
     up with a velocity to the right (also positive). So acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, as is
     always the case.



             EXAMPLE 2.5

     Calculate Acceleration: A Subway Train Slowing Down
     Now suppose that at the end of its trip, the train in Figure 2.18(a) slows to a stop from a speed of 30.0 km/h in 8.00

     Strategy

     In this case, the train is decelerating and its acceleration is negative because it is toward the left. As in the previous
     example, we must find the change in velocity and the change in time and then solve for acceleration.

     Solution

     1. Identify the knowns.                     ,             (the train is stopped, so its velocity is 0), and            .

     4. Convert the units to meters and seconds.

                                                                                                                          2.18


     Discussion

     The minus sign indicates that acceleration is to the left. This sign is reasonable because the train initially has a
     positive velocity in this problem, and a negative acceleration would oppose the motion. Again, acceleration is in the
     same direction as the change in velocity, which is negative here. This acceleration can be called a deceleration
     because it has a direction opposite to the velocity.

     negative displacement.

Discussion

The plus sign means that acceleration is to the right. This is reasonable because the train initially has a negative
velocity (to the left) in this problem and a positive acceleration opposes the motion (and so it is to the right). Again,
acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, which is positive here. As in Example 2.5, this
acceleration can be called a deceleration since it is in the direction opposite to the velocity.


Sign and Direction
Perhaps the most important thing to note about these examples is the signs of the answers. In our chosen
coordinate system, plus means the quantity is to the right and minus means it is to the left. This is easy to imagine
for displacement and velocity. But it is a little less obvious for acceleration. Most people interpret negative
acceleration as the slowing of an object. This was not the case in Example 2.7, where a positive acceleration slowed
a negative velocity. The crucial distinction was that the acceleration was in the opposite direction from the velocity.
In fact, a negative acceleration will increase a negative velocity. For example, the train moving to the left in Figure
2.22 is sped up by an acceleration to the left. In that case, both and are negative. The plus and minus signs give
the directions of the accelerations. If acceleration has the same sign as the velocity, the object is speeding up. If
acceleration has the opposite sign as the velocity, the object is slowing down.

    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
An airplane lands on a runway traveling east. Describe its acceleration.
Solution
If we take east to be positive, then the airplane has negative acceleration, as it is accelerating toward the west. It is
also decelerating: its acceleration is opposite in direction to its velocity.

     2.5 Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension
     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      • Calculate displacement of an object that is not accelerating, given initial position and velocity.
      • Calculate final velocity of an accelerating object, given initial velocity, acceleration, and time.
      • Calculate displacement and final position of an accelerating object, given initial position, initial velocity,
         time, and acceleration.

     We might know that the greater the acceleration of, say, a car moving away from a stop sign, the greater the
     displacement in a given time. But we have not developed a specific equation that relates acceleration and
     displacement. In this section, we develop some convenient equations for kinematic relationships, starting from the
     definitions of displacement, velocity, and acceleration already covered.

     Notation: t, x, v, a
     First, let us make some simplifications in notation. Taking the initial time to be zero, as if time is measured with a
     stopwatch, is a great simplification. Since elapsed time is                    , taking        means that         , the final
     time on the stopwatch. When initial time is taken to be zero, we use the subscript 0 to denote initial values of
     position and velocity. That is,       is the initial position and  is the initial velocity. We put no subscripts on the final
     values. That is, is the final time, is the final position, and is the final velocity. This gives a simpler expression for
     elapsed time—now,             . It also simplifies the expression for displacement, which is now                   . Also, it
     simplifies the expression for change in velocity, which is now                      . To summarize, using the simplified
     notation, with the initial time taken to be zero,


                                                                                                                                    2.24


     where the subscript 0 denotes an initial value and the absence of a subscript denotes a final value in whatever
     motion is under consideration.

We now make the important assumption that acceleration is constant. This assumption allows us to avoid using
calculus to find instantaneous acceleration. Since acceleration is constant, the average and instantaneous
accelerations are equal. That is,
                                                                                                                      2.25
so we use the symbol for acceleration at all times. Assuming acceleration to be constant does not seriously limit
the situations we can study nor degrade the accuracy of our treatment. For one thing, acceleration is constant in a
great number of situations. Furthermore, in many other situations we can accurately describe motion by assuming a
constant acceleration equal to the average acceleration for that motion. Finally, in motions where acceleration
changes drastically, such as a car accelerating to top speed and then braking to a stop, the motion can be
considered in separate parts, each of which has its own constant acceleration.


  Solving for Displacement ( ) and Final Position ( ) from Average Velocity when
  Acceleration ( ) is Constant
  To get our first two new equations, we start with the definition of average velocity:

                                                                                                                    2.26

  Substituting the simplified notation for     and     yields

                                                                                                                    2.27

  Solving for    yields
                                                                                                                    2.28
  where the average velocity is

                                                                                                                    2.29



The equation              reflects the fact that, when acceleration is constant,    is just the simple average of the
initial and final velocities. For example, if you steadily increase your velocity (that is, with constant acceleration)
from 30 to 60 km/h, then your average velocity during this steady increase is 45 km/h. Using the equation
           to check this, we see that

                                                                                                                      2.30

which seems logical.

     Discussion

     Velocity and final displacement are both positive, which means they are in the same direction.


     The equation                 gives insight into the relationship between displacement, average velocity, and time. It
     shows, for example, that displacement is a linear function of average velocity. (By linear function, we mean that
     displacement depends on rather than on raised to some other power, such as . When graphed, linear
     functions look like straight lines with a constant slope.) On a car trip, for example, we will get twice as far in a given
     time if we average 90 km/h than if we average 45 km/h.

     another object will move twice as far as the other object.

Discussion

The final velocity is much less than the initial velocity, as desired when slowing down, but still positive. With jet
engines, reverse thrust could be maintained long enough to stop the plane and start moving it backward. That would
be indicated by a negative final velocity, which is not the case here.

62   2 • Kinematics



     Note that the acceleration is negative because its direction is opposite to its velocity, which is positive.



     In addition to being useful in problem solving, the equation             gives us insight into the relationships
     among velocity, acceleration, and time. From it we can see, for example, that

       • final velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and how long it lasts
       • if the acceleration is zero, then the final velocity equals the initial velocity                               , as expected (i.e., velocity is
         constant)
       • if is negative, then the final velocity is less than the initial velocity

     (All of these observations fit our intuition, and it is always useful to examine basic equations in light of our intuition
     and experiences to check that they do indeed describe nature accurately.)

       FIGURE 2.29 The Space Shuttle Endeavor blasts off from the Kennedy Space Center in February 2010. (credit: Matthew Simantov,
       Flickr)

       An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) has a larger average acceleration than the Space Shuttle and
       achieves a greater velocity in the first minute or two of flight (actual ICBM burn times are classified—short-burn-
       time missiles are more difficult for an enemy to destroy). But the Space Shuttle obtains a greater final velocity,
       so that it can orbit the earth rather than come directly back down as an ICBM does. The Space Shuttle does this
       by accelerating for a longer time.



       Solving for Final Position When Velocity is Not Constant (                                                   )
       We can combine the equations above to find a third equation that allows us to calculate the final position of an
       object experiencing constant acceleration. We start with
                                                                                                                                                2.37
       Adding        to each side of this equation and dividing by 2 gives

                                                                                                                                                2.38

       Since                for constant acceleration, then

                                                                                                                                                2.39

1. Identify the knowns. Starting from rest means that                   ,   is given as              and is given as 5.56 s.

2. Plug the known values into the equation to solve for the unknown :

     Discussion

     If we convert 402 m to miles, we find that the distance covered is very close to one quarter of a mile, the standard
     distance for drag racing. So the answer is reasonable. This is an impressive displacement in only 5.56 s, but top-
     notch dragsters can do a quarter mile in even less time than this.


     What else can we learn by examining the equation                                  We see that:

      • displacement depends on the square of the elapsed time when acceleration is not zero. In Example 2.10, the
        dragster covers only one fourth of the total distance in the first half of the elapsed time
      • if acceleration is zero, then the initial velocity equals average velocity (       ) and
          becomes


       Solving for Final Velocity when Velocity Is Not Constant (                               )
       A fourth useful equation can be obtained from another algebraic manipulation of previous equations.

       If we solve                for , we get

                                                                                                                         2.45

       Substituting this and              into              , we get

                                                                                                                         2.46

     Calculate the final velocity of the dragster in Example 2.10 without using information about time.

     The equation                            is ideally suited to this task because it relates velocities, acceleration, and
     displacement, and no time information is required.

     Solution

     1. Identify the known values. We know that         , since the dragster starts from rest. Then we note that
                       (this was the answer in Example 2.10). Finally, the average acceleration was given to be
                     .

Thus

                                                                                                                   2.48

To get , we take the square root:

                                                                                                                   2.49

Discussion

145 m/s is about 522 km/h or about 324 mi/h, but even this breakneck speed is short of the record for the quarter
mile. Also, note that a square root has two values; we took the positive value to indicate a velocity in the same
direction as the acceleration.


An examination of the equation                         can produce further insights into the general relationships
among physical quantities:

 • The final velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and the distance over which it acts
 • For a fixed deceleration, a car that is going twice as fast doesn’t simply stop in twice the distance—it takes much
   further to stop. (This is why we have reduced speed zones near schools.)

Putting Equations Together
In the following examples, we further explore one-dimensional motion, but in situations requiring slightly more
algebraic manipulation. The examples also give insight into problem-solving techniques. The box below provides
easy reference to the equations needed.

                                                          FIGURE 2.33

     In order to determine which equations are best to use, we need to list all of the known values and identify exactly
     what we need to solve for. We shall do this explicitly in the next several examples, using tables to set them off.

     Solution for (a)

     1. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that                 ;      ;                 ( is
     negative because it is in a direction opposite to velocity). We take to be 0. We are looking for displacement    , or
            .

     2. Identify the equation that will help up solve the problem. The best equation to use is

                                                                                                                     2.55

     This equation is best because it includes only one unknown, . We know the values of all the other variables in this
     equation. (There are other equations that would allow us to solve for , but they require us to know the stopping
     time, , which we do not know. We could use them but it would entail additional calculations.)

     3. Rearrange the equation to solve for .

                                                                                                                     2.56

     4. Enter known values.


                                                                                                                     2.57


     Thus,

                                                                                                                     2.58

     Solution for (b)

     This part can be solved in exactly the same manner as Part A. The only difference is that the deceleration is
                 . The result is
                                                                                                                     2.59
     Solution for (c)

     Once the driver reacts, the stopping distance is the same as it is in Parts A and B for dry and wet concrete. So to
     answer this question, we need to calculate how far the car travels during the reaction time, and then add that to the
     stopping time. It is reasonable to assume that the velocity remains constant during the driver’s reaction time.

     1. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that                 ;                   ;               .
     We take             to be 0. We are looking for        .

     2. Identify the best equation to use.

                works well because the only unknown value is , which is what we want to solve for.

3. Plug in the knowns to solve the equation.
                                                                                                                                       2.60
This means the car travels 15.0 m while the driver reacts, making the total displacements in the two cases of dry
and wet concrete 15.0 m greater than if he reacted instantly.

4. Add the displacement during the reaction time to the displacement when braking.

                                                                                                                                       2.61

a. 64.3 m + 15.0 m = 79.3 m when dry
b. 90.0 m + 15.0 m = 105 m when wet




FIGURE 2.34 The distance necessary to stop a car varies greatly, depending on road conditions and driver reaction time. Shown here are
the braking distances for dry and wet pavement, as calculated in this example, for a car initially traveling at 30.0 m/s. Also shown are the
total distances traveled from the point where the driver first sees a light turn red, assuming a 0.500 s reaction time.

Discussion

The displacements found in this example seem reasonable for stopping a fast-moving car. It should take longer to
stop a car on wet rather than dry pavement. It is interesting that reaction time adds significantly to the
displacements. But more important is the general approach to solving problems. We identify the knowns and the
quantities to be determined and then find an appropriate equation. There is often more than one way to solve a
problem. The various parts of this example can in fact be solved by other methods, but the solutions presented
above are the shortest.



        EXAMPLE 2.13

Calculating Time: A Car Merges into Traffic
Suppose a car merges into freeway traffic on a 200-m-long ramp. If its initial velocity is 10.0 m/s and it accelerates

engineer.)

     We are asked to solve for the time . As before, we identify the known quantities in order to choose a convenient
     physical relationship (that is, an equation with one unknown, ).

     Solution

     1. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that                   ;                ; and               .

     2. We need to solve for . Choose the best equation.                            works best because the only unknown in
     the equation is the variable for which we need to solve.

     3. We will need to rearrange the equation to solve for . In this case, it will be easier to plug in the knowns first.

                                                                                                                             2.62

     4. Simplify the equation. The units of meters (m) cancel because they are in each term. We can get the units of
     seconds (s) to cancel by taking        , where is the magnitude of time and s is the unit. Doing so leaves

                                                                                                                             2.63

     5. Use the quadratic formula to solve for .

     (a) Rearrange the equation to get 0 on one side of the equation.

                                                                                                                             2.64

     This is a quadratic equation of the form

                                                                                                                             2.65

     where the constants are                                        .

     (b) Its solutions are given by the quadratic formula:

                                                                                                                             2.66

     This yields two solutions for , which are
                                                                                                                             2.67
     In this case, then, the time is     in seconds, or
                                                                                                                             2.68
     A negative value for time is unreasonable, since it would mean that the event happened 20 s before the motion
     began. We can discard that solution. Thus,
                                                                                                                             2.69

are meaningful, but in others, such as the above, only one solution is reasonable. The 10.0 s answer seems
reasonable for a typical freeway on-ramp.


With the basics of kinematics established, we can go on to many other interesting examples and applications. In the
process of developing kinematics, we have also glimpsed a general approach to problem solving that produces both
correct answers and insights into physical relationships. Problem-Solving Basics discusses problem-solving basics
and outlines an approach that will help you succeed in this invaluable task.


 Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Breaking News
 We have been using SI units of meters per second squared to describe some examples of acceleration or
 deceleration of cars, runners, and trains. To achieve a better feel for these numbers, one can measure the
 braking deceleration of a car doing a slow (and safe) stop. Recall that, for average acceleration,           .
 While traveling in a car, slowly apply the brakes as you come up to a stop sign. Have a passenger note the initial
 speed in miles per hour and the time taken (in seconds) to stop. From this, calculate the deceleration in miles
 per hour per second. Convert this to meters per second squared and compare with other decelerations
 mentioned in this chapter. Calculate the distance traveled in braking.

Problem-solving skills are obviously essential to success in a quantitative course in physics. More importantly, the
ability to apply broad physical principles, usually represented by equations, to specific situations is a very powerful
70   2 • Kinematics



     form of knowledge. It is much more powerful than memorizing a list of facts. Analytical skills and problem-solving
     abilities can be applied to new situations, whereas a list of facts cannot be made long enough to contain every
     possible circumstance. Such analytical skills are useful both for solving problems in this text and for applying
     physics in everyday and professional life.

     Problem-Solving Steps
     While there is no simple step-by-step method that works for every problem, the following general procedures
     facilitate problem solving and make it more meaningful. A certain amount of creativity and insight is required as
     well.

     Step 1
     Examine the situation to determine which physical principles are involved. It often helps to draw a simple sketch at
     the outset. You will also need to decide which direction is positive and note that on your sketch. Once you have
     identified the physical principles, it is much easier to find and apply the equations representing those principles.
     Although finding the correct equation is essential, keep in mind that equations represent physical principles, laws of
     nature, and relationships among physical quantities. Without a conceptual understanding of a problem, a numerical
     solution is meaningless.

     Step 2
     Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). Many problems are
     stated very succinctly and require some inspection to determine what is known. A sketch can also be very useful at
     this point. Formally identifying the knowns is of particular importance in applying physics to real-world situations.
     Remember, “stopped” means velocity is zero, and we often can take initial time and position as zero.

     Step 3
     Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). In complex problems,
     especially, it is not always obvious what needs to be found or in what sequence. Making a list can help.

     Step 4
     Find an equation or set of equations that can help you solve the problem. Your list of knowns and unknowns can
     help here. It is easiest if you can find equations that contain only one unknown—that is, all of the other variables are
     known, so you can easily solve for the unknown. If the equation contains more than one unknown, then an
     additional equation is needed to solve the problem. In some problems, several unknowns must be determined to
     get at the one needed most. In such problems it is especially important to keep physical principles in mind to avoid
     going astray in a sea of equations. You may have to use two (or more) different equations to get the final answer.

     Step 5
     Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation, and obtain numerical solutions complete
     with units. This step produces the numerical answer; it also provides a check on units that can help you find errors.
     If the units of the answer are incorrect, then an error has been made. However, be warned that correct units do not
     guarantee that the numerical part of the answer is also correct.

     Step 6
     Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? This final step is extremely important—the goal of
     physics is to accurately describe nature. To see if the answer is reasonable, check both its magnitude and its sign, in
     addition to its units. Your judgment will improve as you solve more and more physics problems, and it will become
     possible for you to make finer and finer judgments regarding whether nature is adequately described by the answer
     to a problem. This step brings the problem back to its conceptual meaning. If you can judge whether the answer is
     reasonable, you have a deeper understanding of physics than just being able to mechanically solve a problem.

     When solving problems, we often perform these steps in different order, and we also tend to do several steps
     simultaneously. There is no rigid procedure that will work every time. Creativity and insight grow with experience,
     and the basics of problem solving become almost automatic. One way to get practice is to work out the text’s
     examples for yourself as you read. Another is to work as many end-of-section problems as possible, starting with
     the easiest to build confidence and progressing to the more difficult. Once you become involved in physics, you will
     see it all around you, and you can begin to apply it to situations you encounter outside the classroom, just as is done

in many of the applications in this text.

Unreasonable Results
Physics must describe nature accurately. Some problems have results that are unreasonable because one premise
is unreasonable or because certain premises are inconsistent with one another. The physical principle applied
correctly then produces an unreasonable result. For example, if a person starting a foot race accelerates at
            for 100 s, his final speed will be 40 m/s (about 150 km/h)—clearly unreasonable because the time of 100
s is an unreasonable premise. The physics is correct in a sense, but there is more to describing nature than just
manipulating equations correctly. Checking the result of a problem to see if it is reasonable does more than help
uncover errors in problem solving—it also builds intuition in judging whether nature is being accurately described.

Use the following strategies to determine whether an answer is reasonable and, if it is not, to determine what is the
cause.

Step 1
Solve the problem using strategies as outlined and in the format followed in the worked examples in the text. In the
example given in the preceding paragraph, you would identify the givens as the acceleration and time and use the
equation below to find the unknown final velocity. That is,

                                                                                                                   2.72

Step 2
Check to see if the answer is reasonable. Is it too large or too small, or does it have the wrong sign, improper units,
…? In this case, you may need to convert meters per second into a more familiar unit, such as miles per hour.

                                                                                                                   2.73

This velocity is about four times greater than a person can run—so it is too large.

Step 3
If the answer is unreasonable, look for what specifically could cause the identified difficulty. In the example of the
runner, there are only two assumptions that are suspect. The acceleration could be too great or the time too long.
First look at the acceleration and think about what the number means. If someone accelerates at                , their
velocity is increasing by 0.4 m/s each second. Does this seem reasonable? If so, the time must be too long. It is not
possible for someone to accelerate at a constant rate of            for 100 s (almost two minutes).

2.7 Falling Objects
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Describe the effects of gravity on objects in motion.
 • Describe the motion of objects that are in free fall.
 • Calculate the position and velocity of objects in free fall.

Falling objects form an interesting class of motion problems. For example, we can estimate the depth of a vertical
mine shaft by dropping a rock into it and listening for the rock to hit the bottom. By applying the kinematics
developed so far to falling objects, we can examine some interesting situations and learn much about gravity in the
process.

Gravity
The most remarkable and unexpected fact about falling objects is that, if air resistance and friction are negligible,
then in a given location all objects fall toward the center of Earth with the same constant acceleration, independent
of their mass. This experimentally determined fact is unexpected, because we are so accustomed to the effects of
air resistance and friction that we expect light objects to fall slower than heavy ones.
72   2 • Kinematics




     FIGURE 2.37 A hammer and a feather will fall with the same constant acceleration if air resistance is considered negligible. This is a
     general characteristic of gravity not unique to Earth, as astronaut David R. Scott demonstrated on the Moon in 1971, where the acceleration
     due to gravity is only           .

     In the real world, air resistance can cause a lighter object to fall slower than a heavier object of the same size. A
     tennis ball will reach the ground after a hard baseball dropped at the same time. (It might be difficult to observe the
     difference if the height is not large.) Air resistance opposes the motion of an object through the air, while friction
     between objects—such as between clothes and a laundry chute or between a stone and a pool into which it is
     dropped—also opposes motion between them. For the ideal situations of these first few chapters, an object falling
     without air resistance or friction is defined to be in free-fall.

     The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth. The acceleration of free-falling objects is
     therefore called the acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity is constant, which means we can
     apply the kinematics equations to any falling object where air resistance and friction are negligible. This opens a
     broad class of interesting situations to us. The acceleration due to gravity is so important that its magnitude is given
     its own symbol, . It is constant at any given location on Earth and has the average value

                                                                                                                                        2.74

     Although varies from                to           , depending on latitude, altitude, underlying geological formations,
     and local topography, the average value of             will be used in this text unless otherwise specified. The
     direction of the acceleration due to gravity is downward (towards the center of Earth). In fact, its direction defines
     what we call vertical. Note that whether the acceleration in the kinematic equations has the value          or
     depends on how we define our coordinate system. If we define the upward direction as positive, then
                             , and if we define the downward direction as positive, then                      .

     One-Dimensional Motion Involving Gravity
     The best way to see the basic features of motion involving gravity is to start with the simplest situations and then
     progress toward more complex ones. So we start by considering straight up and down motion with no air resistance
     or friction. These assumptions mean that the velocity (if there is any) is vertical. If the object is dropped, we know
     the initial velocity is zero. Once the object has left contact with whatever held or threw it, the object is in free-fall.
     Under these circumstances, the motion is one-dimensional and has constant acceleration of magnitude . We will
     also represent vertical displacement with the symbol and use for horizontal displacement.

       EXAMPLE 2.14

Calculating Position and Velocity of a Falling Object: A Rock Thrown Upward
A person standing on the edge of a high cliff throws a rock straight up with an initial velocity of 13.0 m/s. The rock
misses the edge of the cliff as it falls back to earth. Calculate the position and velocity of the rock 1.00 s, 2.00 s, and
3.00 s after it is thrown, neglecting the effects of air resistance.

Strategy

Draw a sketch.




                                                         FIGURE 2.38

We are asked to determine the position at various times. It is reasonable to take the initial position      to be zero.
This problem involves one-dimensional motion in the vertical direction. We use plus and minus signs to indicate
direction, with up being positive and down negative. Since up is positive, and the rock is thrown upward, the initial
velocity must be positive too. The acceleration due to gravity is downward, so is negative. It is crucial that the
initial velocity and the acceleration due to gravity have opposite signs. Opposite signs indicate that the acceleration
due to gravity opposes the initial motion and will slow and eventually reverse it.

Since we are asked for values of position and velocity at three times, we will refer to these as      and       ;   and         ;
and    and .

Solution for Position


1. Identify the knowns. We know that                 ;           ;                        ; and             .

2. Identify the best equation to use. We will use                         because it includes only one unknown,           (or
  , here), which is the value we want to find.

Discussion

The rock is 8.10 m above its starting point at             s, since       . It could be moving up or down; the only way
to tell is to calculate and find out if it is positive or negative.

Solution for Velocity


1. Identify the knowns. We know that                 ;           ;                        ; and             . We also know
from the solution above that                 .

     Discussion

     The positive value for   means that the rock is still heading upward at             . However, it has slowed from its

FIGURE 2.39 Vertical position, vertical velocity, and vertical acceleration vs. time for a rock thrown vertically up at the edge of a cliff. Notice
that velocity changes linearly with time and that acceleration is constant. Misconception Alert! Notice that the position vs. time graph shows
vertical position only. It is easy to get the impression that the graph shows some horizontal motion—the shape of the graph looks like the
path of a projectile. But this is not the case; the horizontal axis is time, not space. The actual path of the rock in space is straight up, and
straight down.

Discussion

The interpretation of these results is important. At 1.00 s the rock is above its starting point and heading upward,
since     and     are both positive. At 2.00 s, the rock is still above its starting point, but the negative velocity means
it is moving downward. At 3.00 s, both        and     are negative, meaning the rock is below its starting point and
continuing to move downward. Notice that when the rock is at its highest point (at 1.5 s), its velocity is zero, but its
acceleration is still             . Its acceleration is              for the whole trip—while it is moving up and while it
is moving down. Note that the values for are the positions (or displacements) of the rock, not the total distances
traveled. Finally, note that free-fall applies to upward motion as well as downward. Both have the same
acceleration—the acceleration due to gravity, which remains constant the entire time. Astronauts training in the
famous Vomit Comet, for example, experience free-fall while arcing up as well as down, as we will discuss in more
detail later.

       Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Reaction Time
       A simple experiment can be done to determine your reaction time. Have a friend hold a ruler between your
       thumb and index finger, separated by about 1 cm. Note the mark on the ruler that is right between your fingers.
       Have your friend drop the ruler unexpectedly, and try to catch it between your two fingers. Note the new reading
       on the ruler. Assuming acceleration is that due to gravity, calculate your reaction time. How far would you travel
       in a car (moving at 30 m/s) if the time it took your foot to go from the gas pedal to the brake was twice this
       reaction time?



             EXAMPLE 2.15

     Calculating Velocity of a Falling Object: A Rock Thrown Down
     What happens if the person on the cliff throws the rock straight down, instead of straight up? To explore this
     question, calculate the velocity of the rock when it is 5.10 m below the starting point, and has been thrown
     downward with an initial speed of 13.0 m/s.

     Strategy

     Draw a sketch.




                                                            FIGURE 2.40

     Since up is positive, the final position of the rock will be negative because it finishes below the starting point at
            . Similarly, the initial velocity is downward and therefore negative, as is the acceleration due to gravity. We
     expect the final velocity to be negative since the rock will continue to move downward.

     Solution

     1. Identify the knowns.           ;             ;                    ;                      .

     2. Choose the kinematic equation that makes it easiest to solve the problem. The equation
     works well because the only unknown in it is . (We will plug         in for .)

     3. Enter the known values

     where we have retained extra significant figures because this is an intermediate result.

     Taking the square root, and noting that a square root can be positive or negative, gives

     The negative root is chosen to indicate that the rock is still heading down. Thus,
                                                                                                                        2.82
     Discussion

     Note that this is exactly the same velocity the rock had at this position when it was thrown straight upward with the
     same initial speed. (See Example 2.14 and Figure 2.41(a).) This is not a coincidental result. Because we only
     consider the acceleration due to gravity in this problem, the speed of a falling object depends only on its initial

speed and its vertical position relative to the starting point. For example, if the velocity of the rock is calculated at a
height of 8.10 m above the starting point (using the method from Example 2.14) when the initial velocity is 13.0 m/s
straight up, a result of           is obtained. Here both signs are meaningful; the positive value occurs when the
rock is at 8.10 m and heading up, and the negative value occurs when the rock is at 8.10 m and heading back down.
It has the same speed but the opposite direction.




FIGURE 2.41 (a) A person throws a rock straight up, as explored in Example 2.14. The arrows are velocity vectors at 0, 1.00, 2.00, and 3.00
s. (b) A person throws a rock straight down from a cliff with the same initial speed as before, as in Example 2.15. Note that at the same
distance below the point of release, the rock has the same velocity in both cases.

Another way to look at it is this: In Example 2.14, the rock is thrown up with an initial velocity of        . It rises
and then falls back down. When its position is         on its way back down, its velocity is          . That is, it has
the same speed on its way down as on its way up. We would then expect its velocity at a position of                     to
be the same whether we have thrown it upwards at                  or thrown it downwards at             . The velocity of
the rock on its way down from           is the same whether we have thrown it up or down to start with, as long as the
speed with which it was initially thrown is the same.

             EXAMPLE 2.16

     Find g from Data on a Falling Object
     The acceleration due to gravity on Earth differs slightly from place to place, depending on topography (e.g., whether
     you are on a hill or in a valley) and subsurface geology (whether there is dense rock like iron ore as opposed to light
     rock like salt beneath you.) The precise acceleration due to gravity can be calculated from data taken in an
     introductory physics laboratory course. An object, usually a metal ball for which air resistance is negligible, is
     dropped and the time it takes to fall a known distance is measured. See, for example, Figure 2.42. Very precise
     results can be produced with this method if sufficient care is taken in measuring the distance fallen and the elapsed
     time.




     FIGURE 2.42 Positions and velocities of a metal ball released from rest when air resistance is negligible. Velocity is seen to increase linearly
     with time while displacement increases with time squared. Acceleration is a constant and is equal to gravitational acceleration.

Discussion

The negative value for indicates that the gravitational acceleration is downward, as expected. We expect the value
to be somewhere around the average value of                , so              makes sense. Since the data going into
the calculation are relatively precise, this value for is more precise than the average value of          ; it
represents the local value for the acceleration due to gravity.

     2.8 Graphical Analysis of One-Dimensional Motion
     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      • Describe a straight-line graph in terms of its slope and y-intercept.
      • Determine average velocity or instantaneous velocity from a graph of position vs. time.
      • Determine average or instantaneous acceleration from a graph of velocity vs. time.
      • Derive a graph of velocity vs. time from a graph of position vs. time.
      • Derive a graph of acceleration vs. time from a graph of velocity vs. time.

     A graph, like a picture, is worth a thousand words. Graphs not only contain numerical information; they also reveal
     relationships between physical quantities. This section uses graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration versus
     time to illustrate one-dimensional kinematics.

     Slopes and General Relationships
     First note that graphs in this text have perpendicular axes, one horizontal and the other vertical. When two physical
     quantities are plotted against one another in such a graph, the horizontal axis is usually considered to be an
     independent variable and the vertical axis a dependent variable. If we call the horizontal axis the -axis and the
     vertical axis the -axis, as in Figure 2.44, a straight-line graph has the general form
                                                                                                                        2.89
     Here is the slope, defined to be the rise divided by the run (as seen in the figure) of the straight line. The letter   is
     used for the y-intercept, which is the point at which the line crosses the vertical axis.

Graph of Position vs. Time (a = 0, so v is constant)
Time is usually an independent variable that other quantities, such as position, depend upon. A graph of position
versus time would, thus, have on the vertical axis and on the horizontal axis. Figure 2.45 is just such a straight-
line graph. It shows a graph of position versus time for a jet-powered car on a very flat dry lake bed in Nevada.




                   FIGURE 2.45 Graph of position versus time for a jet-powered car on the Bonneville Salt Flats.

Using the relationship between dependent and independent variables, we see that the slope in the graph above is
average velocity and the intercept is position at time zero—that is, . Substituting these symbols into
gives
                                                                                                                          2.90
or
                                                                                                                          2.91
Thus a graph of position versus time gives a general relationship among displacement(change in position), velocity,
and time, as well as giving detailed numerical information about a specific situation.


 The Slope of x vs. t
 The slope of the graph of position      vs. time is velocity .

                                                                                                                        2.92

 Notice that this equation is the same as that derived algebraically from other motion equations in Motion
 Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension.


From the figure we can see that the car has a position of 525 m at 0.50 s and 2000 m at 6.40 s. Its position at other
times can be read from the graph; furthermore, information about its velocity and acceleration can also be obtained
from the graph.

Strategy

The slope of a graph of vs. is average velocity, since slope equals rise over run. In this case, rise = change in
position and run = change in time, so that

     Since the slope is constant here, any two points on the graph can be used to find the slope. (Generally speaking, it is
     most accurate to use two widely separated points on the straight line. This is because any error in reading data from
     the graph is proportionally smaller if the interval is larger.)

     Solution

     1. Choose two points on the line. In this case, we choose the points labeled on the graph: (6.4 s, 2000 m) and (0.50
     s, 525 m). (Note, however, that you could choose any two points.)

     2. Substitute the and values of the chosen points into the equation. Remember in calculating change            we
     always use final value minus initial value.

     This is an impressively large land speed (900 km/h, or about 560 mi/h): much greater than the typical highway
     speed limit of 60 mi/h (27 m/s or 96 km/h), but considerably shy of the record of 343 m/s (1234 km/h or 766 mi/h)

     The graph of position versus time in Figure 2.46(a) is a curve rather than a straight line. The slope of the curve
     becomes steeper as time progresses, showing that the velocity is increasing over time. The slope at any point on a
     position-versus-time graph is the instantaneous velocity at that point. It is found by drawing a straight line tangent
     to the curve at the point of interest and taking the slope of this straight line. Tangent lines are shown for two points
     in Figure 2.46(a). If this is done at every point on the curve and the values are plotted against time, then the graph of
     velocity versus time shown in Figure 2.46(b) is obtained. Furthermore, the slope of the graph of velocity versus time
     is acceleration, which is shown in Figure 2.46(c).


             EXAMPLE 2.18

     Determining Instantaneous Velocity from the Slope at a Point: Jet Car
     Calculate the velocity of the jet car at a time of 25 s by finding the slope of the             vs. graph in the graph below.




     FIGURE 2.48 The slope of an   vs. graph is velocity. This is shown at two points. Instantaneous velocity at any point is the slope of the
     tangent at that point.

     Strategy

     The slope of a curve at a point is equal to the slope of a straight line tangent to the curve at that point. This principle
     is illustrated in Figure 2.48, where Q is the point at         .

     Solution

     1. Find the tangent line to the curve at               .

     2. Determine the endpoints of the tangent. These correspond to a position of 1300 m at time 19 s and a position of
     3120 m at time 32 s.

     3. Plug these endpoints into the equation to solve for the slope, .

Thus,

                                                                                                                        2.97

Discussion

This is the value given in this figure’s table for   at          . The value of 140 m/s for     is plotted in Figure 2.48.
The entire graph of    vs. can be obtained in this fashion.


Carrying this one step further, we note that the slope of a velocity versus time graph is acceleration. Slope is rise
divided by run; on a vs. graph, rise = change in velocity       and run = change in time .


  The Slope of v vs. t
  The slope of a graph of velocity     vs. time is acceleration .

                                                                                                                      2.98



Since the velocity versus time graph in Figure 2.46(b) is a straight line, its slope is the same everywhere, implying
that acceleration is constant. Acceleration versus time is graphed in Figure 2.46(c).

Additional general information can be obtained from Figure 2.48 and the expression for a straight line,                      .

In this case, the vertical axis   is   , the intercept    is   , the slope   is , and the horizontal axis   is . Substituting
these symbols yields
                                                                                                                        2.99
A general relationship for velocity, acceleration, and time has again been obtained from a graph. Notice that this
equation was also derived algebraically from other motion equations in Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration
in One Dimension.

It is not accidental that the same equations are obtained by graphical analysis as by algebraic techniques. In fact, an
important way to discover physical relationships is to measure various physical quantities and then make graphs of
one quantity against another to see if they are correlated in any way. Correlations imply physical relationships and
might be shown by smooth graphs such as those above. From such graphs, mathematical relationships can
sometimes be postulated. Further experiments are then performed to determine the validity of the hypothesized
relationships.

Graphs of Motion Where Acceleration is Not Constant
Now consider the motion of the jet car as it goes from 165 m/s to its top velocity of 250 m/s, graphed in Figure 2.49.
Time again starts at zero, and the initial velocity is 165 m/s. (This was the final velocity of the car in the motion
graphed in Figure 2.46.) Acceleration gradually decreases from               to zero when the car hits 250 m/s. The
velocity increases until 55 s and then becomes constant, since acceleration decreases to zero at 55 s and remains
zero afterward.

     (a) The velocity gradually approaches its top value. The slope of this graph is acceleration. It is plotted in the final graph. (b) Acceleration
     gradually declines to zero when velocity becomes constant. Notice in each of the three graphs that the acceleration drops down to zero and
     the velocity levels out. This results in a position-time graph that is almost linear. A close-up of the position time graph would show a slight
     curvature, as indicated in the velocity graph.

     The slope of the curve at                 is equal to the slope of the line tangent at that point, as illustrated in Figure

versus time can be used to generate a graph of acceleration versus time. We do this by finding the slope of the
graphs at every point. If the graph is linear (i.e., a line with a constant slope), it is easy to find the slope at any point
and you have the slope for every point. Graphical analysis of motion can be used to describe both specific and
general characteristics of kinematics. Graphs can also be used for other topics in physics. An important aspect of
exploring physical relationships is to graph them and look for underlying relationships.

Two-Dimensional Kinematics




FIGURE 3.1 Hitting a tennis ball is difficult enough when it is traveling at high speeds in a relatively straight line. However, most motion is in
curved, rather than straight-line, paths. Tennis players must account for the arc of the ball and the impact of its spin, while they also predict
how it will bounce and plan the location of their shot. Motion along a curved path is two- or three-dimensional motion, and can be
described in a similar fashion to one-dimensional motion. (credit: Edwin Martinez/Flickr)

INTRODUCTION TO TWO-DIMENSIONAL KINEMATICS The arc of a basketball, the orbit of a satellite, a bicycle
rounding a curve, a swimmer diving into a pool, blood gushing out of a wound, and a puppy chasing its tail are but a
few examples of motions along curved paths. In fact, most motions in nature follow curved paths rather than
straight lines. Motion along a curved path on a flat surface or a plane (such as that of a ball on a pool table or a
skater on an ice rink) is two-dimensional, and thus described by two-dimensional kinematics. Motion not confined
to a plane, such as a car following a winding mountain road, is described by three-dimensional kinematics. Both
two- and three-dimensional kinematics are simple extensions of the one-dimensional kinematics developed for
straight-line motion in the previous chapter. This simple extension will allow us to apply physics to many more
situations, and it will also yield unexpected insights about nature.

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Observe that motion in two dimensions consists of horizontal and vertical components.
       • Understand the independence of horizontal and vertical vectors in two-dimensional motion.

      The straight-line path that a helicopter might fly is blocked to you as a pedestrian, and so you are forced to take a
      two-dimensional path, such as the one shown. You walk 14 blocks in all, 9 east followed by 5 north. What is the
      straight-line distance?

      An old adage states that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. The two legs of the trip and the
      straight-line path form a right triangle, and so the Pythagorean theorem,               , can be used to find the
      straight-line distance.




      FIGURE 3.4 The Pythagorean theorem relates the length of the legs of a right triangle, labeled      and , with the hypotenuse, labeled . The
      relationship is given by:            . This can be rewritten, solving for :                .

The hypotenuse of the triangle is the straight-line path, and so in this case its length in units of city blocks is
                                             , considerably shorter than the 14 blocks you walked. (Note that we are
using three significant figures in the answer. Although it appears that “9” and “5” have only one significant digit,
they are discrete numbers. In this case “9 blocks” is the same as “9.0 or 9.00 blocks.” We have decided to use three
significant figures in the answer in order to show the result more precisely.)




FIGURE 3.5 The straight-line path followed by a helicopter between the two points is shorter than the 14 blocks walked by the pedestrian.
All blocks are square and the same size.

The fact that the straight-line distance (10.3 blocks) in Figure 3.5 is less than the total distance walked (14 blocks)
is one example of a general characteristic of vectors. (Recall that vectors are quantities that have both magnitude
and direction.)

As for one-dimensional kinematics, we use arrows to represent vectors. The length of the arrow is proportional to
the vector’s magnitude. The arrow’s length is indicated by hash marks in Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.5. The arrow points
in the same direction as the vector. For two-dimensional motion, the path of an object can be represented with three
vectors: one vector shows the straight-line path between the initial and final points of the motion, one vector shows
the horizontal component of the motion, and one vector shows the vertical component of the motion. The horizontal
and vertical components of the motion add together to give the straight-line path. For example, observe the three
vectors in Figure 3.5. The first represents a 9-block displacement east. The second represents a 5-block
displacement north. These vectors are added to give the third vector, with a 10.3-block total displacement. The third
vector is the straight-line path between the two points. Note that in this example, the vectors that we are adding are
perpendicular to each other and thus form a right triangle. This means that we can use the Pythagorean theorem to
calculate the magnitude of the total displacement. (Note that we cannot use the Pythagorean theorem to add
vectors that are not perpendicular. We will develop techniques for adding vectors having any direction, not just
those perpendicular to one another, in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods and Vector Addition and
Subtraction: Analytical Methods.)

The Independence of Perpendicular Motions
The person taking the path shown in Figure 3.5 walks east and then north (two perpendicular directions). How far
they walk east is only affected by their motion eastward. Similarly, how far they walk north is only affected by their
motion northward.


  Independence of Motion
  The horizontal and vertical components of two-dimensional motion are independent of each other. Any motion
  in the horizontal direction does not affect motion in the vertical direction, and vice versa.


This is true in a simple scenario like that of walking in one direction first, followed by another. It is also true of more
complicated motion involving movement in two directions at once. For example, let’s compare the motions of two
baseballs. One baseball is dropped from rest. At the same instant, another is thrown horizontally from the same
height and follows a curved path. A stroboscope has captured the positions of the balls at fixed time intervals as
they fall.
102   3 • Two-Dimensional Kinematics




      FIGURE 3.6 This shows the motions of two identical balls—one falls from rest, the other has an initial horizontal velocity. Each subsequent
      position is an equal time interval. Arrows represent horizontal and vertical velocities at each position. The ball on the right has an initial
      horizontal velocity, while the ball on the left has no horizontal velocity. Despite the difference in horizontal velocities, the vertical velocities
      and positions are identical for both balls. This shows that the vertical and horizontal motions are independent.

      It is remarkable that for each flash of the strobe, the vertical positions of the two balls are the same. This similarity
      implies that the vertical motion is independent of whether or not the ball is moving horizontally. (Assuming no air
      resistance, the vertical motion of a falling object is influenced by gravity only, and not by any horizontal forces.)
      Careful examination of the ball thrown horizontally shows that it travels the same horizontal distance between
      flashes. This is due to the fact that there are no additional forces on the ball in the horizontal direction after it is
      thrown. This result means that the horizontal velocity is constant, and affected neither by vertical motion nor by
      gravity (which is vertical). Note that this case is true only for ideal conditions. In the real world, air resistance will
      affect the speed of the balls in both directions.

      The two-dimensional curved path of the horizontally thrown ball is composed of two independent one-dimensional
      motions (horizontal and vertical). The key to analyzing such motion, called projectile motion, is to resolve (break) it
      into motions along perpendicular directions. Resolving two-dimensional motion into perpendicular components is
      possible because the components are independent. We shall see how to resolve vectors in Vector Addition and
      Subtraction: Graphical Methods and Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods. We will find such
      techniques to be useful in many areas of physics.

FIGURE 3.7 Displacement can be determined graphically using a scale map, such as this one of the Hawaiian Islands. A journey from
Hawai’i to Moloka’i has a number of legs, or journey segments. These segments can be added graphically with a ruler to determine the total

Vectors in Two Dimensions
A vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force, for example,
are all vectors. In one-dimensional, or straight-line, motion, the direction of a vector can be given simply by a plus or
minus sign. In two dimensions (2-d), however, we specify the direction of a vector relative to some reference frame
(i.e., coordinate system), using an arrow having length proportional to the vector’s magnitude and pointing in the
direction of the vector.

Figure 3.8 shows such a graphical representation of a vector, using as an example the total displacement for the
person walking in a city considered in Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction. We shall use the notation
that a boldface symbol, such as , stands for a vector. Its magnitude is represented by the symbol in italics, , and
its direction by .


  Vectors in this Text
  In this text, we will represent a vector with a boldface variable. For example, we will represent the quantity force
  with the vector , which has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the vector will be represented by a
  variable in italics, such as , and the direction of the variable will be given by an angle .




       FIGURE 3.8 A person walks 9 blocks east and 5 blocks north. The displacement is 10.3 blocks at an angle        north of east.
104   3 • Two-Dimensional Kinematics




      FIGURE 3.9 To describe the resultant vector for the person walking in a city considered in Figure 3.8 graphically, draw an arrow to represent
      the total displacement vector . Using a protractor, draw a line at an angle relative to the east-west axis. The length of the arrow is
      proportional to the vector’s magnitude and is measured along the line with a ruler. In this example, the magnitude of the vector is 10.3
      units, and the direction is      north of east.

      Vector Addition: Head-to-Tail Method
      The head-to-tail method is a graphical way to add vectors, described in Figure 3.10 below and in the steps
      following. The tail of the vector is the starting point of the vector, and the head (or tip) of a vector is the final,
      pointed end of the arrow.




      FIGURE 3.10 Head-to-Tail Method: The head-to-tail method of graphically adding vectors is illustrated for the two displacements of the
      person walking in a city considered in Figure 3.8. (a) Draw a vector representing the displacement to the east. (b) Draw a vector
      representing the displacement to the north. The tail of this vector should originate from the head of the first, east-pointing vector. (c) Draw a
      line from the tail of the east-pointing vector to the head of the north-pointing vector to form the sum or resultant vector . The length of
      the arrow is proportional to the vector’s magnitude and is measured to be 10.3 units . Its direction, described as the angle with respect
      to the east (or horizontal axis) is measured with a protractor to be        .

      Step 1. Draw an arrow to represent the first vector (9 blocks to the east) using a ruler and protractor.

Step 2. Now draw an arrow to represent the second vector (5 blocks to the north). Place the tail of the second vector
at the head of the first vector.




                                                       FIGURE 3.12

Step 3. If there are more than two vectors, continue this process for each vector to be added. Note that in our
example, we have only two vectors, so we have finished placing arrows tip to tail.

Step 4. Draw an arrow from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector. This is the resultant, or the sum,
of the other vectors.




                                                       FIGURE 3.13

Step 5. To get the magnitude of the resultant, measure its length with a ruler. (Note that in most calculations, we
will use the Pythagorean theorem to determine this length.)
106   3 • Two-Dimensional Kinematics



      Step 6. To get the direction of the resultant, measure the angle it makes with the reference frame using a
      protractor. (Note that in most calculations, we will use trigonometric relationships to determine this angle.)

      The graphical addition of vectors is limited in accuracy only by the precision with which the drawings can be made
      and the precision of the measuring tools. It is valid for any number of vectors.


              EXAMPLE 3.1

      Adding Vectors Graphically Using the Head-to-Tail Method: A Woman Takes a Walk
      Use the graphical technique for adding vectors to find the total displacement of a person who walks the following
      three paths (displacements) on a flat field. First, she walks 25.0 m in a direction      north of east. Then, she walks
      23.0 m heading        north of east. Finally, she turns and walks 32.0 m in a direction 68.0° south of east.

      Strategy

      Represent each displacement vector graphically with an arrow, labeling the first , the second , and the third ,
      making the lengths proportional to the distance and the directions as specified relative to an east-west line. The
      head-to-tail method outlined above will give a way to determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant
      displacement, denoted .

      Solution

      (1) Draw the three displacement vectors.

(4) Use a ruler to measure the magnitude of , and a protractor to measure the direction of . While the direction of
the vector can be specified in many ways, the easiest way is to measure the angle between the vector and the
nearest horizontal or vertical axis. Since the resultant vector is south of the eastward pointing axis, we flip the
protractor upside down and measure the angle between the eastward axis and the vector.




                                                     FIGURE 3.17

In this case, the total displacement is seen to have a magnitude of 50.8 m and to lie in a direction          south of
east. By using its magnitude and direction, this vector can be expressed as             and                south of east.

Discussion

The head-to-tail graphical method of vector addition works for any number of vectors. It is also important to note
that the resultant is independent of the order in which the vectors are added. Therefore, we could add the vectors in
any order as illustrated in Figure 3.18 and we will still get the same solution.




                                                     FIGURE 3.18

Here, we see that when the same vectors are added in a different order, the result is the same. This characteristic is
true in every case and is an important characteristic of vectors. Vector addition is commutative. Vectors can be
108   3 • Two-Dimensional Kinematics



      added in any order.
                                                                                                                                              3.1
      (This is true for the addition of ordinary numbers as well—you get the same result whether you add                             or        ,
      for example).


      Vector Subtraction
      Vector subtraction is a straightforward extension of vector addition. To define subtraction (say we want to subtract
      from , written           , we must first define what we mean by subtraction. The negative of a vector is defined to
      be     ; that is, graphically the negative of any vector has the same magnitude but the opposite direction, as shown in
      Figure 3.19. In other words, has the same length as           , but points in the opposite direction. Essentially, we just
      flip the vector so it points in the opposite direction.




      FIGURE 3.19 The negative of a vector is just another vector of the same magnitude but pointing in the opposite direction. So   is the
      negative of  ; it has the same length but opposite direction.

      The subtraction of vector from vector is then simply defined to be the addition of           to . Note that vector
      subtraction is the addition of a negative vector. The order of subtraction does not affect the results.
                                                                                                                                              3.2
      This is analogous to the subtraction of scalars (where, for example,               ). Again, the result is
      independent of the order in which the subtraction is made. When vectors are subtracted graphically, the techniques
      outlined above are used, as the following example illustrates.


              EXAMPLE 3.2

      Subtracting Vectors Graphically: A Woman Sailing a Boat
      A woman sailing a boat at night is following directions to a dock. The instructions read to first sail 27.5 m in a
      direction        north of east from her current location, and then travel 30.0 m in a direction       north of east (or
             west of north). If the woman makes a mistake and travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the
      trip, where will she end up? Compare this location with the location of the dock.

Strategy

We can represent the first leg of the trip with a vector , and the second leg of the trip with a vector . The dock is
located at a location         . If the woman mistakenly travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the
journey, she will travel a distance (30.0 m) in the direction                      south of east. We represent this as
   , as shown below. The vector         has the same magnitude as but is in the opposite direction. Thus, she will end
up at a location          , or        .




                                                        FIGURE 3.21

We will perform vector addition to compare the location of the dock,             , with the location at which the woman
mistakenly arrives,          .

Solution

(1) To determine the location at which the woman arrives by accident, draw vectors          and     .

(2) Place the vectors head to tail.

(3) Draw the resultant vector    .

(4) Use a ruler and protractor to measure the magnitude and direction of        .

110   3 • Two-Dimensional Kinematics



      (5) To determine the location of the dock, we repeat this method to add vectors      and    . We obtain the resultant
      vector :




                                                             FIGURE 3.23

      In this case               and           north of east.

      We can see that the woman will end up a significant distance from the dock if she travels in the opposite direction
      for the second leg of the trip.

      Discussion

      Because subtraction of a vector is the same as addition of a vector with the opposite direction, the graphical method
      of subtracting vectors works the same as for addition.


      Multiplication of Vectors and Scalars
      If we decided to walk three times as far on the first leg of the trip considered in the preceding example, then we
      would walk                , or 82.5 m, in a direction      north of east. This is an example of multiplying a vector by a
      positive scalar. Notice that the magnitude changes, but the direction stays the same.

      If the scalar is negative, then multiplying a vector by it changes the vector’s magnitude and gives the new vector the
      opposite direction. For example, if you multiply by –2, the magnitude doubles but the direction changes. We can
      summarize these rules in the following way: When vector is multiplied by a scalar ,

       • the magnitude of the vector becomes the absolute value of         ,
       • if is positive, the direction of the vector does not change,
       • if is negative, the direction is reversed.

      In our case,       and              . Vectors are multiplied by scalars in many situations. Note that division is the
      inverse of multiplication. For example, dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by the value (1/2). The rules for
      multiplication of vectors by scalars are the same for division; simply treat the divisor as a scalar between 0 and 1.

      Resolving a Vector into Components
      In the examples above, we have been adding vectors to determine the resultant vector. In many cases, however, we
      will need to do the opposite. We will need to take a single vector and find what other vectors added together
      produce it. In most cases, this involves determining the perpendicular components of a single vector, for example
      the x- and y-components, or the north-south and east-west components.

      For example, we may know that the total displacement of a person walking in a city is 10.3 blocks in a direction
            north of east and want to find out how many blocks east and north had to be walked. This method is called
      finding the components (or parts) of the displacement in the east and north directions, and it is the inverse of the
      process followed to find the total displacement. It is one example of finding the components of a vector. There are
      many applications in physics where this is a useful thing to do. We will see this soon in Projectile Motion, and much
      more when we cover forces in Dynamics: Newton’s Laws of Motion. Most of these involve finding components along

3.3 Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Understand the rules of vector addition and subtraction using analytical methods.
 • Apply analytical methods to determine vertical and horizontal component vectors.
 • Apply analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of a resultant vector.

Analytical methods of vector addition and subtraction employ geometry and simple trigonometry rather than the
ruler and protractor of graphical methods. Part of the graphical technique is retained, because vectors are still
represented by arrows for easy visualization. However, analytical methods are more concise, accurate, and precise
than graphical methods, which are limited by the accuracy with which a drawing can be made. Analytical methods
are limited only by the accuracy and precision with which physical quantities are known.

Resolving a Vector into Perpendicular Components
Analytical techniques and right triangles go hand-in-hand in physics because (among other things) motions along
perpendicular directions are independent. We very often need to separate a vector into perpendicular components.
For example, given a vector like in Figure 3.24, we may wish to find which two perpendicular vectors,     and   ,
add to produce it.




FIGURE 3.24 The vector , with its tail at the origin of an x, y-coordinate system, is shown together with its x- and y-components,     and
   . These vectors form a right triangle. The analytical relationships among these vectors are summarized below.

    and      are defined to be the components of             along the x- and y-axes. The three vectors           ,     , and        form a
right triangle:

                                                                                                                                       3.3

Note that this relationship between vector components and the resultant vector holds only for vector quantities
(which include both magnitude and direction). The relationship does not apply for the magnitudes alone. For

Note that the equation                         is just the Pythagorean theorem relating the legs of a right triangle to the

length of the hypotenuse. For example, if    and     are 9 and 5 blocks, respectively, then

  Determining Vectors and Vector Components with Analytical Methods
  Equations                    and                   are used to find the perpendicular components of a vector—that is,
  to go from     and    to     and      . Equations                        and                          are used to find a vector
  from its perpendicular components—that is, to go from               and        to   and . Both processes are crucial to
  analytical methods of vector addition and subtraction.


Adding Vectors Using Analytical Methods
To see how to add vectors using perpendicular components, consider Figure 3.28, in which the vectors                        and       are
added to produce the resultant .

      have walked first in the x-direction and then in the y-direction. Those paths are the x- and y-components of the
      resultant,      and      . If we know       and      , we can find      and    using the equations                             and
                       . When you use the analytical method of vector addition, you can determine the components or
      the magnitude and direction of a vector.

      Step 1. Identify the x- and y-axes that will be used in the problem. Then, find the components of each vector to be
      added along the chosen perpendicular axes. Use the equations                     and               to find the
      components. In Figure 3.29, these components are          ,   ,   , and   . The angles that vectors and make
      with the x-axis are     and    , respectively.

      Step 2. Find the components of the resultant along each axis by adding the components of the individual vectors
      along that axis. That is, as shown in Figure 3.30,
                                                                                                                                        3.12

      FIGURE 3.30 The magnitude of the vectors    and    add to give the magnitude     of the resultant vector in the horizontal direction.
      Similarly, the magnitudes of the vectors and    add to give the magnitude    of the resultant vector in the vertical direction.

      Components along the same axis, say the x-axis, are vectors along the same line and, thus, can be added to one
      another like ordinary numbers. The same is true for components along the y-axis. (For example, a 9-block eastward
      walk could be taken in two legs, the first 3 blocks east and the second 6 blocks east, for a total of 9, because they
      are along the same direction.) So resolving vectors into components along common axes makes it easier to add
      them. Now that the components of are known, its magnitude and direction can be found.

      Step 3. To get the magnitude          of the resultant, use the Pythagorean theorem:

Step 4. To get the direction of the resultant relative to the x-axis:

                                                                                                                                3.15

The following example illustrates this technique for adding vectors using perpendicular components.


        EXAMPLE 3.3

Adding Vectors Using Analytical Methods
Add the vector to the vector shown in Figure 3.31, using perpendicular components along the x- and y-axes.
The x- and y-axes are along the east–west and north–south directions, respectively. Vector represents the first
leg of a walk in which a person walks       in a direction    north of east. Vector represents the second leg, a
displacement of           in a direction   north of east.




FIGURE 3.31 Vector has magnitude               and direction      north of the x-axis. Vector has magnitude     and direction
north of the x-axis. You can use analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of .

Strategy

The components of and along the x- and y-axes represent walking due east and due north to get to the same
ending point. Once found, they are combined to produce the resultant.

Solution

Following the method outlined above, we first find the components of and along the x- and y-axes. Note that

gives

Similarly, the y-components are found using                           :


                                                                                                                                3.18

and

                                                                                                                                3.19
116   3 • Two-Dimensional Kinematics



      The x- and y-components of the resultant are thus
                                                                                                                                  3.20
      and

                                                                                                                                  3.21

      Now we can find the magnitude of the resultant by using the Pythagorean theorem:

                                                                                                                                  3.22

      so that
                                                                                                                                  3.23
      Finally, we find the direction of the resultant:

                                                                                                                                  3.24

      Thus,

                                                                                                                                  3.25




                FIGURE 3.32 Using analytical methods, we see that the magnitude of   is   and its direction is   north of east.

      Discussion

      This example illustrates the addition of vectors using perpendicular components. Vector subtraction using
      perpendicular components is very similar—it is just the addition of a negative vector.

      Subtraction of vectors is accomplished by the addition of a negative vector. That is,                 . Thus, the
      method for the subtraction of vectors using perpendicular components is identical to that for addition. The
      components of      are the negatives of the components of . The x- and y-components of the resultant
      are thus
                                                                                                                                  3.26
      and

                                                                                                                                  3.27

      and the rest of the method outlined above is identical to that for addition. (See Figure 3.33.)


      Analyzing vectors using perpendicular components is very useful in many areas of physics, because perpendicular
      quantities are often independent of one another. The next module, Projectile Motion, is one of many in which using
      perpendicular components helps make the picture clear and simplifies the physics.

3.4 Projectile Motion
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Identify and explain the properties of a projectile, such as acceleration due to gravity, range, maximum
    height, and trajectory.
 • Determine the location and velocity of a projectile at different points in its trajectory.
 • Apply the principle of independence of motion to solve projectile motion problems.

Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration of
gravity. The object is called a projectile, and its path is called its trajectory. The motion of falling objects, as covered
in Problem-Solving Basics for One-Dimensional Kinematics, is a simple one-dimensional type of projectile motion in
which there is no horizontal movement. In this section, we consider two-dimensional projectile motion, such as that
of a football or other object for which air resistance is negligible.

The most important fact to remember here is that motions along perpendicular axes are independent and thus can
be analyzed separately. This fact was discussed in Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction, where vertical
and horizontal motions were seen to be independent. The key to analyzing two-dimensional projectile motion is to
break it into two motions, one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical. (This choice of axes is the
most sensible, because acceleration due to gravity is vertical—thus, there will be no acceleration along the
horizontal axis when air resistance is negligible.) As is customary, we call the horizontal axis the x-axis and the
vertical axis the y-axis. Figure 3.34 illustrates the notation for displacement, where is defined to be the total
displacement and and are its components along the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The magnitudes of
these vectors are s, x, and y. (Note that in the last section we used the notation to represent a vector with
components         and     . If we continued this format, we would call displacement with components          and .
However, to simplify the notation, we will simply represent the component vectors as and .)

Of course, to describe motion we must deal with velocity and acceleration, as well as with displacement. We must
find their components along the x- and y-axes, too. We will assume all forces except gravity (such as air resistance
and friction, for example) are negligible. The components of acceleration are then very simple:
                       . (Note that this definition assumes that the upwards direction is defined as the positive
118   3 • Two-Dimensional Kinematics



      direction. If you arrange the coordinate system instead such that the downwards direction is positive, then
      acceleration due to gravity takes a positive value.) Because gravity is vertical,   . Both accelerations are
      constant, so the kinematic equations can be used.

      A Fireworks Projectile Explodes High and Away
      During a fireworks display, a shell is shot into the air with an initial speed of 70.0 m/s at an angle of        above the
      horizontal, as illustrated in Figure 3.36. The fuse is timed to ignite the shell just as it reaches its highest point above
      the ground. (a) Calculate the height at which the shell explodes. (b) How much time passed between the launch of

      Strategy

      Because air resistance is negligible for the unexploded shell, the analysis method outlined above can be used. The

Solution for (a)

By “height” we mean the altitude or vertical position above the starting point. The highest point in any trajectory,
called the apex, is reached when        . Since we know the initial and final velocities as well as the initial position,
we use the following equation to find :

                                                                                                                                          3.45




FIGURE 3.36 The trajectory of a fireworks shell. The fuse is set to explode the shell at the highest point in its trajectory, which is found to be
at a height of 233 m and 125 m away horizontally.

Because        and      are both zero, the equation simplifies to

                                                                                                                                          3.46

Solving for     gives


                                                                                                                                          3.47


Now we must find           , the component of the initial velocity in the y-direction. It is given by                                , where
      is the initial velocity of 70.0 m/s, and                    is the initial angle. Thus,

                                                                                                                                          3.48

so that
                                                                                                                                          3.50

Discussion for (a)

Note that because up is positive, the initial velocity is positive, as is the maximum height, but the acceleration due to
gravity is negative. Note also that the maximum height depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity,
so that any projectile with a 67.6 m/s initial vertical component of velocity will reach a maximum height of 233 m
(neglecting air resistance). The numbers in this example are reasonable for large fireworks displays, the shells of
which do reach such heights before exploding. In practice, air resistance is not completely negligible, and so the
initial velocity would have to be somewhat larger than that given to reach the same height.
122   3 • Two-Dimensional Kinematics



      Solution for (b)

      As in many physics problems, there is more than one way to solve for the time to the highest point. In this case, the
      easiest method is to use                       . Because    is zero, this equation reduces to simply

                                                                                                                           3.51

      Note that the final vertical velocity,   , at the highest point is zero. Thus,


                                                                                                                           3.52


      Discussion for (b)

      This time is also reasonable for large fireworks. When you are able to see the launch of fireworks, you will notice
      several seconds pass before the shell explodes. (Another way of finding the time is by using                                ,
      and solving the quadratic equation for .)

      Solution for (c)

      Because air resistance is negligible,        and the horizontal velocity is constant, as discussed above. The
      horizontal displacement is horizontal velocity multiplied by time as given by                , where   is equal to
      zero:
                                                                                                                           3.53
      where      is the x-component of the velocity, which is given by                     Now,
                                                                                                                           3.54
      The time for both motions is the same, and so        is
                                                                                                                           3.55

      Discussion for (c)

      The horizontal motion is a constant velocity in the absence of air resistance. The horizontal displacement found here
      could be useful in keeping the fireworks fragments from falling on spectators. Once the shell explodes, air
      resistance has a major effect, and many fragments will land directly below.


      In solving part (a) of the preceding example, the expression we found for        is valid for any projectile motion where
      air resistance is negligible. Call the maximum height      ; then,


                                                                                                                           3.56


      This equation defines the maximum height of a projectile and depends only on the vertical component of the initial
      velocity.


        Defining a Coordinate System
        It is important to set up a coordinate system when analyzing projectile motion. One part of defining the
        coordinate system is to define an origin for the and positions. Often, it is convenient to choose the initial
        position of the object as the origin such that          and         . It is also important to define the positive and
        negative directions in the and directions. Typically, we define the positive vertical direction as upwards, and
        the positive horizontal direction is usually the direction of the object’s motion. When this is the case, the vertical
        acceleration, , takes a negative value (since it is directed downwards towards the Earth). However, it is
        occasionally useful to define the coordinates differently. For example, if you are analyzing the motion of a ball

  thrown downwards from the top of a cliff, it may make sense to define the positive direction downwards since
  the motion of the ball is solely in the downwards direction. If this is the case, takes a positive value.



       EXAMPLE 3.5

Calculating Projectile Motion: Hot Rock Projectile
Kilauea in Hawaii is the world’s most continuously active volcano. Very active volcanoes characteristically eject red-
hot rocks and lava rather than smoke and ash. Suppose a large rock is ejected from the volcano with a speed of 25.0
m/s and at an angle        above the horizontal, as shown in Figure 3.37. The rock strikes the side of the volcano at
an altitude 20.0 m lower than its starting point. (a) Calculate the time it takes the rock to follow this path. (b) What
are the magnitude and direction of the rock’s velocity at impact?

Strategy

Again, resolving this two-dimensional motion into two independent one-dimensional motions will allow us to solve
for the desired quantities. The time a projectile is in the air is governed by its vertical motion alone. We will solve for
 first. While the rock is rising and falling vertically, the horizontal motion continues at a constant velocity. This
example asks for the final velocity. Thus, the vertical and horizontal results will be recombined to obtain and          at
the final time determined in the first part of the example.

Solution for (a)

While the rock is in the air, it rises and then falls to a final position 20.0 m lower than its starting altitude. We can find
the time for this by using

                                                                                                                            3.57

If we take the initial position to be zero, then the final position is                        Now the initial vertical velocity is
the vertical component of the initial velocity, found from                         =(           )(         )=            .
Substituting known values yields

                                                                                                                            3.58

Rearranging terms gives a quadratic equation in :

                                                                                                                            3.59

This expression is a quadratic equation of the form                          , where the constants are              ,            ,
and            Its solutions are given by the quadratic formula:

                                                                                                                            3.60

This equation yields two solutions:              and              . (It is left as an exercise for the reader to verify these

      solutions.) The time is            or         . The negative value of time implies an event before the start of motion,
      and so we discard it. Thus,
                                                                                                                          3.61
      Discussion for (a)

      The time for projectile motion is completely determined by the vertical motion. So any projectile that has an initial
      vertical velocity of 14.3 m/s and lands 20.0 m below its starting altitude will spend 3.96 s in the air.

      Solution for (b)

      From the information now in hand, we can find the final horizontal and vertical velocities      and     and combine
      them to find the total velocity and the angle        it makes with the horizontal. Of course,   is constant so we can
      solve for it at any horizontal location. In this case, we chose the starting point since we know both the initial velocity
      and initial angle. Therefore:
                                                                                                                          3.62
      The final vertical velocity is given by the following equation:
                                                                                                                          3.63
      where       was found in part (a) to be          . Thus,

                                                                                                                          3.64

      so that

                                                                                                                          3.65

      To find the magnitude of the final velocity   we combine its perpendicular components, using the following
      equation:

      Thus,

      Discussion for (b)

      The negative angle means that the velocity is        below the horizontal. This result is consistent with the fact that
      the final vertical velocity is negative and hence downward—as you would expect because the final altitude is 20.0 m
      lower than the initial altitude. (See Figure 3.37.)


      One of the most important things illustrated by projectile motion is that vertical and horizontal motions are
      independent of each other. Galileo was the first person to fully comprehend this characteristic. He used it to predict
      the range of a projectile. On level ground, we define range to be the horizontal distance traveled by a projectile.
      Galileo and many others were interested in the range of projectiles primarily for military purposes—such as aiming
      cannons. However, investigating the range of projectiles can shed light on other interesting phenomena, such as the
      orbits of satellites around the Earth. Let us consider projectile range further.

(b) The effect of initial angle on the range of a projectile with a given initial speed. Note that the range is the same for  and       ,
although the maximum heights of those paths are different.

How does the initial velocity of a projectile affect its range? Obviously, the greater the initial speed , the greater
the range, as shown in Figure 3.38(a). The initial angle          also has a dramatic effect on the range, as illustrated in
Figure 3.38(b). For a fixed initial speed, such as might be produced by a cannon, the maximum range is obtained
with           . This is true only for conditions neglecting air resistance. If air resistance is considered, the maximum
angle is approximately        . Interestingly, for every initial angle except    , there are two angles that give the same
range—the sum of those angles is          . The range also depends on the value of the acceleration of gravity . The
lunar astronaut Alan Shepherd was able to drive a golf ball a great distance on the Moon because gravity is weaker
there. The range of a projectile on level ground for which air resistance is negligible is given by

                                                                                                                                        3.71

where    is the initial speed and  is the initial angle relative to the horizontal. The proof of this equation is left as
an end-of-chapter problem (hints are given), but it does fit the major features of projectile range as described.

When we speak of the range of a projectile on level ground, we assume that is very small compared with the
circumference of the Earth. If, however, the range is large, the Earth curves away below the projectile and
acceleration of gravity changes direction along the path. The range is larger than predicted by the range equation
given above because the projectile has farther to fall than it would on level ground. (See Figure 3.39.) If the initial
speed is great enough, the projectile goes into orbit. This possibility was recognized centuries before it could be
accomplished. When an object is in orbit, the Earth curves away from underneath the object at the same rate as it
falls. The object thus falls continuously but never hits the surface. These and other aspects of orbital motion, such
as the rotation of the Earth, will be covered analytically and in greater depth later in this text.

Once again we see that thinking about one topic, such as the range of a projectile, can lead us to others, such as the
Earth orbits. In Addition of Velocities, we will examine the addition of velocities, which is another important aspect
of two-dimensional kinematics and will also yield insights beyond the immediate topic.

      3.5 Addition of Velocities
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Apply principles of vector addition to determine relative velocity.
       • Explain the significance of the observer in the measurement of velocity.

      Relative Velocity
      If a person rows a boat across a rapidly flowing river and tries to head directly for the other shore, the boat instead
      moves diagonally relative to the shore, as in Figure 3.40. The boat does not move in the direction in which it is
      pointed. The reason, of course, is that the river carries the boat downstream. Similarly, if a small airplane flies
      overhead in a strong crosswind, you can sometimes see that the plane is not moving in the direction in which it is
      pointed, as illustrated in Figure 3.41. The plane is moving straight ahead relative to the air, but the movement of the
      air mass relative to the ground carries it sideways.

FIGURE 3.40 A boat trying to head straight across a river will actually move diagonally relative to the shore as shown. Its total velocity
(solid arrow) relative to the shore is the sum of its velocity relative to the river plus the velocity of the river relative to the shore.




FIGURE 3.41 An airplane heading straight north is instead carried to the west and slowed down by wind. The plane does not move relative
to the ground in the direction it points; rather, it moves in the direction of its total velocity (solid arrow).

In each of these situations, an object has a velocity relative to a medium (such as a river) and that medium has a
velocity relative to an observer on solid ground. The velocity of the object relative to the observer is the sum of these
velocity vectors, as indicated in Figure 3.40 and Figure 3.41. These situations are only two of many in which it is
useful to add velocities. In this module, we first re-examine how to add velocities and then consider certain aspects
of what relative velocity means.

How do we add velocities? Velocity is a vector (it has both magnitude and direction); the rules of vector addition
discussed in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods and Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical
Methods apply to the addition of velocities, just as they do for any other vectors. In one-dimensional motion, the
addition of velocities is simple—they add like ordinary numbers. For example, if a field hockey player is moving at
      straight toward the goal and drives the ball in the same direction with a velocity of       relative to her body,
then the velocity of the ball is      relative to the stationary, profusely sweating goalkeeper standing in front of
the goal.

In two-dimensional motion, either graphical or analytical techniques can be used to add velocities. We will
concentrate on analytical techniques. The following equations give the relationships between the magnitude and

      These equations are valid for any vectors and are adapted specifically for velocity. The first two equations are used
      to find the components of a velocity when its magnitude and direction are known. The last two are used to find the
      magnitude and direction of velocity when its components are known.

        EXAMPLE 3.6

Adding Velocities: A Boat on a River




FIGURE 3.43 A boat attempts to travel straight across a river at a speed 0.75 m/s. The current in the river, however, flows at a speed of
1.20 m/s to the right.

Refer to Figure 3.43, which shows a boat trying to go straight across the river. Let us calculate the magnitude and
direction of the boat’s velocity relative to an observer on the shore,   . The velocity of the boat,     , is 0.75 m/s
in the -direction relative to the river and the velocity of the river,  , is 1.20 m/s to the right.

Strategy

We start by choosing a coordinate system with its -axis parallel to the velocity of the river, as shown in Figure 3.43.
Because the boat is directed straight toward the other shore, its velocity relative to the water is parallel to the -axis
and perpendicular to the velocity of the river. Thus, we can add the two velocities by using the equations
                      and                         directly.

Solution

The magnitude of the total velocity is

                                                                                                                                      3.76

where
                                                                                                                                      3.77

Thus,

                                                                                                                                      3.79

      This equation gives

      Discussion

      Both the magnitude and the direction of the total velocity are consistent with Figure 3.43. Note that because the
      velocity of the river is large compared with the velocity of the boat, it is swept rapidly downstream. This result is
      evidenced by the small angle (only        ) the total velocity has relative to the riverbank.

      Calculating Velocity: Wind Velocity Causes an Airplane to Drift
      Calculate the wind velocity for the situation shown in Figure 3.44. The plane is known to be moving at 45.0 m/s due
      north relative to the air mass, while its velocity relative to the ground (its total velocity) is 38.0 m/s in a direction
            west of north.

      north. What is the speed and direction of the wind?

      Strategy

      In this problem, somewhat different from the previous example, we know the total velocity       and that it is the
      sum of two other velocities,   (the wind) and    (the plane relative to the air mass). The quantity   is known, and
      we are asked to find    . None of the velocities are perpendicular, but it is possible to find their components along a
      common set of perpendicular axes. If we can find the components of          , then we can combine them to solve for its
      magnitude and direction. As shown in Figure 3.44, we choose a coordinate system with its x-axis due east and its
      y-axis due north (parallel to ). (You may wish to look back at the discussion of the addition of vectors using
      perpendicular components in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods.)

      Solution

      Because         is the vector sum of the         and     , its x- and y-components are the sums of the x- and y-components
      of the wind and plane velocities. Note that the plane only has vertical component of velocity so                             and

We can use the first of these two equations to find      :

The minus sign indicates motion west which is consistent with the diagram.

Now, to find        we note that

                                                                                                                    3.91

giving

Discussion

The wind’s speed and direction are consistent with the significant effect the wind has on the total velocity of the
plane, as seen in Figure 3.44. Because the plane is fighting a strong combination of crosswind and head-wind, it
ends up with a total velocity significantly less than its velocity relative to the air mass as well as heading in a
different direction.


Note that in both of the last two examples, we were able to make the mathematics easier by choosing a coordinate
system with one axis parallel to one of the velocities. We will repeatedly find that choosing an appropriate
coordinate system makes problem solving easier. For example, in projectile motion we always use a coordinate
system with one axis parallel to gravity.

Relative Velocities and Classical Relativity
When adding velocities, we have been careful to specify that the velocity is relative to some reference frame. These
velocities are called relative velocities. For example, the velocity of an airplane relative to an air mass is different
from its velocity relative to the ground. Both are quite different from the velocity of an airplane relative to its
passengers (which should be close to zero). Relative velocities are one aspect of relativity, which is defined to be
the study of how different observers moving relative to each other measure the same phenomenon.
132   3 • Two-Dimensional Kinematics



      Nearly everyone has heard of relativity and immediately associates it with Albert Einstein (1879–1955), the greatest
      physicist of the 20th century. Einstein revolutionized our view of nature with his modern theory of relativity, which
      we shall study in later chapters. The relative velocities in this section are actually aspects of classical relativity, first
      discussed correctly by Galileo and Isaac Newton. Classical relativity is limited to situations where speeds are less
      than about 1% of the speed of light—that is, less than                . Most things we encounter in daily life move
      slower than this speed.

      Let us consider an example of what two different observers see in a situation analyzed long ago by Galileo. Suppose
      a sailor at the top of a mast on a moving ship drops their binoculars. Where will it hit the deck? Will it hit at the base
      of the mast, or will it hit behind the mast because the ship is moving forward? The answer is that if air resistance is
      negligible, the binoculars will hit at the base of the mast at a point directly below its point of release. Now let us
      consider what two different observers see when the binoculars drop. One observer is on the ship and the other on
      shore. The binoculars have no horizontal velocity relative to the observer on the ship, and so he sees them fall
      straight down the mast. (See Figure 3.45.) To the observer on shore, the binoculars and the ship have the same
      horizontal velocity, so both move the same distance forward while the binoculars are falling. This observer sees the
      curved path shown in Figure 3.45. Although the paths look different to the different observers, each sees the same
      result—the binoculars hit at the base of the mast and not behind it. To get the correct description, it is crucial to
      correctly specify the velocities relative to the observer.




      FIGURE 3.45 Classical relativity. The same motion as viewed by two different observers. An observer on the moving ship sees the
      binoculars dropped from the top of its mast fall straight down. An observer on shore sees the binoculars take the curved path, moving
      forward with the ship. Both observers see the binoculars strike the deck at the base of the mast. The initial horizontal velocity is different
      relative to the two observers. (The ship is shown moving rather fast to emphasize the effect.)

FIGURE 3.46 The motion of a coin dropped inside an airplane as viewed by two different observers. (a) An observer in the plane sees the
coin fall straight down. (b) An observer on the ground sees the coin move almost horizontally.

Strategy

Both problems can be solved with the techniques for falling objects and projectiles. In part (a), the initial velocity of
the coin is zero relative to the plane, so the motion is that of a falling object (one-dimensional). In part (b), the initial
velocity is 260 m/s horizontal relative to the Earth and gravity is vertical, so this motion is a projectile motion. In
both parts, it is best to use a coordinate system with vertical and horizontal axes.

Solution for (a)

Using the given information, we note that the initial velocity and position are zero, and the final position is 1.50 m.
The final velocity can be found using the equation:

                                                                                                                                  3.93

Substituting known values into the equation, we get

                                                                                                                                  3.94

yielding

                                                                                                                                  3.95

We know that the square root of 29.4 has two roots: 5.42 and -5.42. We choose the negative root because we know
that the velocity is directed downwards, and we have defined the positive direction to be upwards. There is no initial
horizontal velocity relative to the plane and no horizontal acceleration, and so the motion is straight down relative to
the plane.

Solution for (b)

Because the initial vertical velocity is zero relative to the ground and vertical motion is independent of horizontal
motion, the final vertical velocity for the coin relative to the ground is                  , the same as found in part (a).
In contrast to part (a), there now is a horizontal component of the velocity. However, since there is no horizontal
acceleration, the initial and final horizontal velocities are the same and                 . The x- and y-components of
velocity can be combined to find the magnitude of the final velocity:

      Discussion

      In part (a), the final velocity relative to the plane is the same as it would be if the coin were dropped from rest on the
      Earth and fell 1.50 m. This result fits our experience; objects in a plane fall the same way when the plane is flying
      horizontally as when it is at rest on the ground. This result is also true in moving cars. In part (b), an observer on the
      ground sees a much different motion for the coin. The plane is moving so fast horizontally to begin with that its final
      velocity is barely greater than the initial velocity. Once again, we see that in two dimensions, vectors do not add like
      ordinary numbers—the final velocity v in part (b) is not                     ; rather, it is          . The velocity’s
      magnitude had to be calculated to five digits to see any difference from that of the airplane. The motions as seen by
      different observers (one in the plane and one on the ground) in this example are analogous to those discussed for
      the binoculars dropped from the mast of a moving ship, except that the velocity of the plane is much larger, so that
      the two observers see very different paths. (See Figure 3.46.) In addition, both observers see the coin fall 1.50 m
      vertically, but the one on the ground also sees it move forward 144 m (this calculation is left for the reader). Thus,
      one observer sees a vertical path, the other a nearly horizontal path.


        Making Connections: Relativity and Einstein
        Because Einstein was able to clearly define how measurements are made (some involve light) and because the
        speed of light is the same for all observers, the outcomes are spectacularly unexpected. Time varies with
        observer, energy is stored as increased mass, and more surprises await.

4.8 Extended Topic: The Four Basic Forces—An Introduction


INTRODUCTION TO DYNAMICS: NEWTON’S LAWS OF MOTION Motion draws our attention. Motion itself can be
beautiful, causing us to marvel at the forces needed to achieve spectacular motion, such as that of a dolphin
jumping out of the water, or a pole vaulter, or the flight of a bird, or the orbit of a satellite. The study of motion is
kinematics, but kinematics only describes the way objects move—their velocity and their acceleration. Dynamics
considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems. Newton’s laws of motion are the
foundation of dynamics. These laws provide an example of the breadth and simplicity of principles under which
nature functions. They are also universal laws in that they apply to similar situations on Earth as well as in space.

Isaac Newton’s (1642–1727) laws of motion were just one part of the monumental work that has made him
legendary. The development of Newton’s laws marks the transition from the Renaissance into the modern era. This
transition was characterized by a revolutionary change in the way people thought about the physical universe. For
many centuries natural philosophers had debated the nature of the universe based largely on certain rules of logic
with great weight given to the thoughts of earlier classical philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BC). Among the
148   4 • Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion



      many great thinkers who contributed to this change were Newton and Galileo.




      FIGURE 4.2 Isaac Newton’s monumental work, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, was published in 1687. It proposed scientific
      laws that are still used today to describe the motion of objects. (credit: Service commun de la documentation de l'Université de Strasbourg)

      Galileo was instrumental in establishing observation as the absolute determinant of truth, rather than “logical”
      argument. Galileo’s use of the telescope was his most notable achievement in demonstrating the importance of
      observation. He discovered moons orbiting Jupiter and made other observations that were inconsistent with certain
      ancient ideas and religious dogma. For this reason, and because of the manner in which he dealt with those in
      authority, Galileo was tried by the Inquisition and punished. He spent the final years of his life under a form of house
      arrest. Because others before Galileo had also made discoveries by observing the nature of the universe, and
      because repeated observations verified those of Galileo, his work could not be suppressed or denied. After his
      death, his work was verified by others, and his ideas were eventually accepted by the church and scientific
      communities.

      Galileo also contributed to the formation of what is now called Newton’s first law of motion. Newton made use of the
      work of his predecessors, which enabled him to develop laws of motion, discover the law of gravity, invent calculus,
      and make great contributions to the theories of light and color. It is amazing that many of these developments were
      made with Newton working alone, without the benefit of the usual interactions that take place among scientists
      today.

      It was not until the advent of modern physics early in the 20th century that it was discovered that Newton’s laws of
      motion produce a good approximation to motion only when the objects are moving at speeds much, much less than
      the speed of light and when those objects are larger than the size of most molecules (about              in diameter).
      These constraints define the realm of classical mechanics, as discussed in Introduction to the Nature of Science and
      Physics. At the beginning of the 20th century, Albert Einstein (1879–1955) developed the theory of relativity and,
      along with many other scientists, developed quantum theory. This theory does not have the constraints present in
      classical physics. All of the situations we consider in this chapter, and all those preceding the introduction of
      relativity in Special Relativity, are in the realm of classical physics.


        Making Connections: Past and Present Philosophy
        The importance of observation and the concept of cause and effect were not always so entrenched in human
        thinking. This realization was a part of the evolution of modern physics from natural philosophy. The
        achievements of Galileo, Newton, Einstein, and others were key milestones in the history of scientific thought.
        Most of the scientific theories that are described in this book descended from the work of these scientists.

4.1 Development of Force Concept
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Understand the definition of force.

Dynamics is the study of the forces that cause objects and systems to move. To understand this, we need a working
definition of force. Our intuitive definition of force—that is, a push or a pull—is a good place to start. We know that a
push or pull has both magnitude and direction (therefore, it is a vector quantity) and can vary considerably in each
regard. For example, a cannon exerts a strong force on a cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, Earth
exerts only a tiny downward pull on a flea. Our everyday experiences also give us a good idea of how multiple forces
add. If two people push in different directions on a third person, as illustrated in Figure 4.3, we might expect the
total force to be in the direction shown. Since force is a vector, it adds just like other vectors, as illustrated in Figure
4.3(a) for two ice skaters. Forces, like other vectors, are represented by arrows and can be added using the familiar
head-to-tail method or by trigonometric methods. These ideas were developed in Two-Dimensional Kinematics.




FIGURE 4.3 Part (a) shows an overhead view of two ice skaters pushing on a third. Forces are vectors and add like other vectors, so the
total force on the third skater is in the direction shown. In part (b), we see a free-body diagram representing the forces acting on the third
skater.

Figure 4.3(b) is our first example of a free-body diagram, which is a technique used to illustrate all the external
forces acting on a body. The body is represented by a single isolated point (or free body), and only those forces
acting on the body from the outside (external forces) are shown. (These forces are the only ones shown, because
only external forces acting on the body affect its motion. We can ignore any internal forces within the body.) Free-
body diagrams are very useful in analyzing forces acting on a system and are employed extensively in the study and
application of Newton’s laws of motion.

A more quantitative definition of force can be based on some standard force, just as distance is measured in units
relative to a standard distance. One possibility is to stretch a spring a certain fixed distance, as illustrated in Figure
4.4, and use the force it exerts to pull itself back to its relaxed shape—called a restoring force—as a standard. The
magnitude of all other forces can be stated as multiples of this standard unit of force. Many other possibilities exist
for standard forces. (One that we will encounter in Magnetism is the magnetic force between two wires carrying
electric current.) Some alternative definitions of force will be given later in this chapter.




FIGURE 4.4 The force exerted by a stretched spring can be used as a standard unit of force. (a) This spring has a length when undistorted.
(b) When stretched a distance     , the spring exerts a restoring force,       , which is reproducible. (c) A spring scale is one device that
uses a spring to measure force. The force          is exerted on whatever is attached to the hook. Here            has a magnitude of 6 units in
the force standard being employed.

        Take-Home Experiment: Force Standards
        To investigate force standards and cause and effect, get two identical rubber bands. Hang one rubber band
        vertically on a hook. Find a small household item that could be attached to the rubber band using a paper clip,
        and use this item as a weight to investigate the stretch of the rubber band. Measure the amount of stretch
        produced in the rubber band with one, two, and four of these (identical) items suspended from the rubber band.
        What is the relationship between the number of items and the amount of stretch? How large a stretch would you
        expect for the same number of items suspended from two rubber bands? What happens to the amount of
        stretch of the rubber band (with the weights attached) if the weights are also pushed to the side with a pencil?


      4.2 Newton’s First Law of Motion: Inertia
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define mass and inertia.
       • Understand Newton's first law of motion.

      Experience suggests that an object at rest will remain at rest if left alone, and that an object in motion tends to slow
      down and stop unless some effort is made to keep it moving. What Newton’s first law of motion states, however, is
      the following:


        Newton’s First Law of Motion
        A body at rest remains at rest, or, if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net
        external force.


      Note the repeated use of the verb “remains.” We can think of this law as preserving the status quo of motion.

      Rather than contradicting our experience, Newton’s first law of motion states that there must be a cause (which is
      a net external force) for there to be any change in velocity (either a change in magnitude or direction). We will define
      net external force in the next section. An object sliding across a table or floor slows down due to the net force of
      friction acting on the object. If friction disappeared, would the object still slow down?

      The idea of cause and effect is crucial in accurately describing what happens in various situations. For example,
      consider what happens to an object sliding along a rough horizontal surface. The object quickly grinds to a halt. If we
      spray the surface with talcum powder to make the surface smoother, the object slides farther. If we make the
      surface even smoother by rubbing lubricating oil on it, the object slides farther yet. Extrapolating to a frictionless
      surface, we can imagine the object sliding in a straight line indefinitely. Friction is thus the cause of the slowing
      (consistent with Newton’s first law). The object would not slow down at all if friction were completely eliminated.
      Consider an air hockey table. When the air is turned off, the puck slides only a short distance before friction slows it
      to a stop. However, when the air is turned on, it creates a nearly frictionless surface, and the puck glides long
      distances without slowing down. Additionally, if we know enough about the friction, we can accurately predict how
      quickly the object will slow down. Friction is an external force.

      Newton’s first law is completely general and can be applied to anything from an object sliding on a table to a
      satellite in orbit to blood pumped from the heart. Experiments have thoroughly verified that any change in velocity
      (speed or direction) must be caused by an external force. The idea of generally applicable or universal laws is
      important not only here—it is a basic feature of all laws of physics. Identifying these laws is like recognizing patterns
      in nature from which further patterns can be discovered. The genius of Galileo, who first developed the idea for the
      first law, and Newton, who clarified it, was to ask the fundamental question, “What is the cause?” Thinking in terms
      of cause and effect is a worldview fundamentally different from the typical ancient Greek approach when questions
      such as “Why does a tiger have stripes?” would have been answered in Aristotelian fashion, “That is the nature of
      the beast.” True perhaps, but not a useful insight.

Mass
The property of a body to remain at rest or to remain in motion with constant velocity is called inertia. Newton’s first
law is often called the law of inertia. As we know from experience, some objects have more inertia than others. It is
obviously more difficult to change the motion of a large boulder than that of a basketball, for example. The inertia of
an object is measured by its mass. Roughly speaking, mass is a measure of the amount of “stuff” (or matter) in
something. The quantity or amount of matter in an object is determined by the numbers of atoms and molecules of
various types it contains. Unlike weight, mass does not vary with location. The mass of an object is the same on
Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the Moon. In practice, it is very difficult to count and identify all of the atoms and
molecules in an object, so masses are not often determined in this manner. Operationally, the masses of objects are
determined by comparison with the standard kilogram.

    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Which has more mass: a kilogram of cotton balls or a kilogram of gold?
Solution
They are equal. A kilogram of one substance is equal in mass to a kilogram of another substance. The quantities that
might differ between them are volume and density.


4.3 Newton’s Second Law of Motion: Concept of a System
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define net force, external force, and system.
 • Understand Newton’s second law of motion.
 • Apply Newton’s second law to determine the weight of an object.

Newton’s second law of motion is closely related to Newton’s first law of motion. It mathematically states the
cause and effect relationship between force and changes in motion. Newton’s second law of motion is more
quantitative and is used extensively to calculate what happens in situations involving a force. Before we can write
down Newton’s second law as a simple equation giving the exact relationship of force, mass, and acceleration, we
need to sharpen some ideas that have already been mentioned.

First, what do we mean by a change in motion? The answer is that a change in motion is equivalent to a change in
velocity. A change in velocity means, by definition, that there is an acceleration. Newton’s first law says that a net
external force causes a change in motion; thus, we see that a net external force causes acceleration.

Another question immediately arises. What do we mean by an external force? An intuitive notion of external is
correct—an external force acts from outside the system of interest. For example, in Figure 4.5(a) the system of
interest is the wagon plus the child in it. The two forces exerted by the other children are external forces. An internal
force acts between elements of the system. Again looking at Figure 4.5(a), the force the child in the wagon exerts to
hang onto the wagon is an internal force between elements of the system of interest. Only external forces affect the
motion of a system, according to Newton’s first law. (The internal forces actually cancel, as we shall see in the next
section.) You must define the boundaries of the system before you can determine which forces are external.
Sometimes the system is obvious, whereas other times identifying the boundaries of a system is more subtle. The
concept of a system is fundamental to many areas of physics, as is the correct application of Newton’s laws. This
concept will be revisited many times on our journey through physics.
152   4 • Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion




      FIGURE 4.5 Different forces exerted on the same mass produce different accelerations. (a) Two children push a wagon with a child in it.
      Arrows representing all external forces are shown. The system of interest is the wagon and its rider. The weight of the system and the
      support of the ground are also shown for completeness and are assumed to cancel. The vector represents the friction acting on the
      wagon, and it acts to the left, opposing the motion of the wagon. (b) All of the external forces acting on the system add together to produce
      a net force,     . The free-body diagram shows all of the forces acting on the system of interest. The dot represents the center of mass of
      the system. Each force vector extends from this dot. Because there are two forces acting to the right, we draw the vectors collinearly. (c) A
      larger net external force produces a larger acceleration (      ) when an adult pushes the child.

      Now, it seems reasonable that acceleration should be directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net
      (total) external force acting on a system. This assumption has been verified experimentally and is illustrated in
      Figure 4.5. In part (a), a smaller force causes a smaller acceleration than the larger force illustrated in part (c). For
      completeness, the vertical forces are also shown; they are assumed to cancel since there is no acceleration in the
      vertical direction. The vertical forces are the weight and the support of the ground , and the horizontal force
      represents the force of friction. These will be discussed in more detail in later sections. For now, we will define
      friction as a force that opposes the motion past each other of objects that are touching. Figure 4.5(b) shows how
      vectors representing the external forces add together to produce a net force,        .

      To obtain an equation for Newton’s second law, we first write the relationship of acceleration and net external force
      as the proportionality
                                                                                                                                              4.1
      where the symbol means “proportional to,” and           is the net external force. (The net external force is the
      vector sum of all external forces and can be determined graphically, using the head-to-tail method, or analytically,
      using components. The techniques are the same as for the addition of other vectors, and are covered in Two-
      Dimensional Kinematics.) This proportionality states what we have said in words—acceleration is directly
      proportional to the net external force. Once the system of interest is chosen, it is important to identify the external
      forces and ignore the internal ones. It is a tremendous simplification not to have to consider the numerous internal
      forces acting between objects within the system, such as muscular forces within the child’s body, let alone the
      myriad of forces between atoms in the objects, but by doing so, we can easily solve some very complex problems
      with only minimal error due to our simplification

      Now, it also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely proportional to the mass of the system. In other
      words, the larger the mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration produced by a given force. And indeed, as
      illustrated in Figure 4.6, the same net external force applied to a car produces a much smaller acceleration than
      when applied to a basketball. The proportionality is written as

                                                                                                                                          4.2

where is the mass of the system. Experiments have shown that acceleration is exactly inversely proportional to
mass, just as it is exactly linearly proportional to the net external force.




FIGURE 4.6 The same force exerted on systems of different masses produces different accelerations. (a) A basketball player pushes on a
basketball to make a pass. (The effect of gravity on the ball is ignored.) (b) The same player exerts an identical force on a stalled SUV and
produces a far smaller acceleration (even if friction is negligible). (c) The free-body diagrams are identical, permitting direct comparison of
the two situations. A series of patterns for the free-body diagram will emerge as you do more problems.

It has been found that the acceleration of an object depends only on the net external force and the mass of the
object. Combining the two proportionalities just given yields Newton's second law of motion.


  Newton’s Second Law of Motion
  The acceleration of a system is directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force acting
  on the system, and inversely proportional to its mass.

  In equation form, Newton’s second law of motion is

                                                                                                                                        4.3

  This is often written in the more familiar form
                                                                                                                                        4.4
  When only the magnitude of force and acceleration are considered, this equation is simply
                                                                                                                                        4.5


Although these last two equations are really the same, the first gives more insight into what Newton’s second law
means. The law is a cause and effect relationship among three quantities that is not simply based on their
definitions. The validity of the second law is completely based on experimental verification.

Units of Force
             is used to define the units of force in terms of the three basic units for mass, length, and time. The SI unit
of force is called the newton (abbreviated N) and is the force needed to accelerate a 1-kg system at the rate of
       . That is, since            ,

                                                                                                                                          4.6

While almost the entire world uses the newton for the unit of force, in the United States the most familiar unit of
force is the pound (lb), where 1 N = 0.225 lb.

Weight and the Gravitational Force
When an object is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth. Newton’s second law states that a net force on
an object is responsible for its acceleration. If air resistance is negligible, the net force on a falling object is the
154   4 • Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion



      gravitational force, commonly called its weight . Weight can be denoted as a vector because it has a direction;
      down is, by definition, the direction of gravity, and hence weight is a downward force. The magnitude of weight is
      denoted as . Galileo was instrumental in showing that, in the absence of air resistance, all objects fall with the
      same acceleration . Using Galileo’s result and Newton’s second law, we can derive an equation for weight.

      Consider an object with mass falling downward toward Earth. It experiences only the downward force of gravity,
      which has magnitude . Newton’s second law states that the magnitude of the net external force on an object is
                .

      Since the object experiences only the downward force of gravity,          . We know that the acceleration of an
      object due to gravity is , or     . Substituting these into Newton’s second law gives


        Weight
        This is the equation for weight—the gravitational force on a mass      :
                                                                                                                         4.7
        Since                   on Earth, the weight of a 1.0 kg object on Earth is 9.8 N, as we see:

                                                                                                                         4.8

        Recall that can take a positive or negative value, depending on the positive direction in the coordinate system.
        Be sure to take this into consideration when solving problems with weight.


      When the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it is in free-fall. That is, the only force acting on
      the object is the force of gravity. In the real world, when objects fall downward toward Earth, they are never truly in
      free-fall because there is always some upward force from the air acting on the object.

      The acceleration due to gravity varies slightly over the surface of Earth, so that the weight of an object depends on
      location and is not an intrinsic property of the object. Weight varies dramatically if one leaves Earth’s surface. On the
      Moon, for example, the acceleration due to gravity is only               . A 1.0-kg mass thus has a weight of 9.8 N on
      Earth and only about 1.7 N on the Moon.

      The broadest definition of weight in this sense is that the weight of an object is the gravitational force on it from the
      nearest large body, such as Earth, the Moon, the Sun, and so on. This is the most common and useful definition of
      weight in physics. It differs dramatically, however, from the definition of weight used by NASA and the popular
      media in relation to space travel and exploration. When they speak of “weightlessness” and “microgravity,” they are
      really referring to the phenomenon we call “free-fall” in physics. We shall use the above definition of weight, and we
      will make careful distinctions between free-fall and actual weightlessness.

      It is important to be aware that weight and mass are very different physical quantities, although they are closely
      related. Mass is the quantity of matter (how much “stuff”) and does not vary in classical physics, whereas weight is
      the gravitational force and does vary depending on gravity. It is tempting to equate the two, since most of our
      examples take place on Earth, where the weight of an object only varies a little with the location of the object.
      Furthermore, the terms mass and weight are used interchangeably in everyday language; for example, our medical
      records often show our “weight” in kilograms, but never in the correct units of newtons.


        Common Misconceptions: Mass vs. Weight
        Mass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday language. However, in science, these terms are
        distinctly different from one another. Mass is a measure of how much matter is in an object. The typical measure
        of mass is the kilogram (or the “slug” in English units). Weight, on the other hand, is a measure of the force of
        gravity acting on an object. Weight is equal to the mass of an object ( ) multiplied by the acceleration due to
        gravity ( ). Like any other force, weight is measured in terms of newtons (or pounds in English units).

        Assuming the mass of an object is kept intact, it will remain the same, regardless of its location. However,

                                                                          4.3 • Newton’s Second Law of Motion: Concept of a System       155



 because weight depends on the acceleration due to gravity, the weight of an object can change when the object
 enters into a region with stronger or weaker gravity. For example, the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is
              (which is much less than the acceleration due to gravity on Earth,           ). If you measured your
 weight on Earth and then measured your weight on the Moon, you would find that you “weigh” much less, even
 though you do not look any skinnier. This is because the force of gravity is weaker on the Moon. In fact, when
 people say that they are “losing weight,” they really mean that they are losing “mass” (which in turn causes
 them to weigh less).



 Take-Home Experiment: Mass and Weight
 What do bathroom scales measure? When you stand on a bathroom scale, what happens to the scale? It
 depresses slightly. The scale contains springs that compress in proportion to your weight—similar to rubber
 bands expanding when pulled. The springs provide a measure of your weight (for an object which is not
 accelerating). This is a force in newtons (or pounds). In most countries, the measurement is divided by 9.80 to
 give a reading in mass units of kilograms. The scale measures weight but is calibrated to provide information
 about mass. While standing on a bathroom scale, push down on a table next to you. What happens to the
 reading? Why? Would your scale measure the same “mass” on Earth as on the Moon?



        EXAMPLE 4.1

What Acceleration Can a Person Produce when Pushing a Lawn Mower?
Suppose that the net external force (push minus friction) exerted on a lawn mower is 51 N (about 11 lb) parallel to
the ground. The mass of the mower is 24 kg. What is its acceleration?




        FIGURE 4.7 The net force on a lawn mower is 51 N to the right. At what rate does the lawn mower accelerate to the right?

Strategy

Since      and     are given, the acceleration can be calculated directly from Newton’s second law as stated in
           .

Solution

The magnitude of the acceleration         is            . Entering known values gives

                                                                                                                                   4.9

Substituting the units               for N yields

                                                                                                                                          4.10

      Discussion

      The direction of the acceleration is the same direction as that of the net force, which is parallel to the ground. There
      is no information given in this example about the individual external forces acting on the system, but we can say
      something about their relative magnitudes. For example, the force exerted by the person pushing the mower must
      be greater than the friction opposing the motion (since we know the mower moves forward), and the vertical forces
      must cancel if there is to be no acceleration in the vertical direction (the mower is moving only horizontally). The
      acceleration found is small enough to be reasonable for a person pushing a mower. Such an effort would not last too
      long because the person’s top speed would soon be reached.

      physiological effects on human subjects at high speeds. They consisted of a platform that was mounted on one or
      two rails and propelled by several rockets. Calculate the magnitude of force exerted by each rocket, called its thrust
        , for the four-rocket propulsion system shown in Figure 4.8. The sled’s initial acceleration is         the mass of
      the system is 2100 kg, and the force of friction opposing the motion is known to be 650 N.




      FIGURE 4.8 A sled experiences a rocket thrust that accelerates it to the right. Each rocket creates an identical thrust . As in other
      situations where there is only horizontal acceleration, the vertical forces cancel. The ground exerts an upward force on the system that is
      equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to its weight, . The system here is the sled, its rockets, and rider, so none of the forces
      between these objects are considered. The arrow representing friction ( ) is drawn larger than scale.

      Strategy

      Although there are forces acting vertically and horizontally, we assume the vertical forces cancel since there is no
      vertical acceleration. This leaves us with only horizontal forces and a simpler one-dimensional problem. Directions
      are indicated with plus or minus signs, with right taken as the positive direction. See the free-body diagram in the
      figure.

      Solution

      Since acceleration, mass, and the force of friction are given, we start with Newton’s second law and look for ways to
      find the thrust of the engines. Since we have defined the direction of the force and acceleration as acting “to the
      right,” we need to consider only the magnitudes of these quantities in the calculations. Hence we begin with

                                                                                                                     4.11
where        is the net force along the horizontal direction. We can see from Figure 4.8 that the engine thrusts add,
while friction opposes the thrust. In equation form, the net external force is
                                                                                                                     4.12
Substituting this into Newton’s second law gives
                                                                                                                     4.13
Using a little algebra, we solve for the total thrust 4T:
                                                                                                                     4.14
Substituting known values yields

                                                                                                                     4.15

So the total thrust is

and the individual thrusts are

Discussion

The numbers are quite large, so the result might surprise you. Experiments such as this were performed in the early
1960s to test the limits of human endurance and the setup designed to protect human subjects in jet fighter
emergency ejections. Speeds of 1000 km/h were obtained, with accelerations of 45 's. (Recall that , the
acceleration due to gravity, is            . When we say that an acceleration is 45 's, it is   ×             , which is
approximately           .) While living subjects are not used any more, land speeds of 10,000 km/h have been
obtained with rocket sleds. In this example, as in the preceding one, the system of interest is obvious. We will see in
later examples that choosing the system of interest is crucial—and the choice is not always obvious.

Newton’s second law of motion is more than a definition; it is a relationship among acceleration, force, and mass. It
can help us make predictions. Each of those physical quantities can be defined independently, so the second law
tells us something basic and universal about nature. The next section introduces the third and final law of motion.


4.4 Newton’s Third Law of Motion: Symmetry in Forces
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Understand Newton's third law of motion.
 • Apply Newton's third law to define systems and solve problems of motion.

Baseball relief pitcher Mariano Rivera was so highly regarded that during his retirement year, opposing teams
conducted farewell presentations when he played at their stadiums. The Minnesota Twins offered a unique gift: A
chair made of broken bats. Any pitch can break a bat, but with Rivera's signature pitch—known as a cutter—the ball
and the bat frequently came together at a point that shattered the hardwood. Typically, we think of a baseball or
softball hitter exerting a force on the incoming ball, and baseball analysts focus on the resulting "exit velocity" as a
key statistic. But the force of the ball can do its own damage. This is exactly what happens whenever one body
exerts a force on another—the first also experiences a force (equal in magnitude and opposite in direction).
Numerous common experiences, such as stubbing a toe or pushing off the floor during a jump, confirm this. It is
precisely stated in Newton’s third law of motion.
158   4 • Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion




        Newton’s Third Law of Motion
        Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the first body experiences a force that is equal in
        magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that it exerts.


      This law represents a certain symmetry in nature: Forces always occur in pairs, and one body cannot exert a force on
      another without experiencing a force itself. We sometimes refer to this law loosely as “action-reaction,” where the
      force exerted is the action and the force experienced as a consequence is the reaction. Newton’s third law has
      practical uses in analyzing the origin of forces and understanding which forces are external to a system.

      We can readily see Newton’s third law at work by taking a look at how people move about. Consider a swimmer
      pushing off from the side of a pool, as illustrated in Figure 4.9. She pushes against the pool wall with her feet and
      accelerates in the direction opposite to that of her push. The wall has exerted an equal and opposite force back on
      the swimmer. You might think that two equal and opposite forces would cancel, but they do not because they act on
      different systems. In this case, there are two systems that we could investigate: the swimmer or the wall. If we
      select the swimmer to be the system of interest, as in the figure, then                is an external force on this system
      and affects its motion. The swimmer moves in the direction of                 . In contrast, the force              acts
      on the wall and not on our system of interest. Thus                 does not directly affect the motion of the system and
      does not cancel              . Note that the swimmer pushes in the direction opposite to that in which she wishes to
      move. The reaction to her push is thus in the desired direction.




      FIGURE 4.9 When the swimmer exerts a force                  on the wall, she accelerates in the direction opposite to that of her push. This
      means the net external force on her is in the direction opposite to             . This opposition occurs because, in accordance with
      Newton’s third law of motion, the wall exerts a force              on her, equal in magnitude but in the direction opposite to the one she
      exerts on it. The line around the swimmer indicates the system of interest. Note that               does not act on this system (the swimmer)
      and, thus, does not cancel              . Thus the free-body diagram shows only                , , the gravitational force, and    , the
      buoyant force of the water supporting the swimmer’s weight. The vertical forces and           cancel since there is no vertical motion.

      Other examples of Newton’s third law are easy to find. As a professor walks in front of a whiteboard, she exerts a
      force backward on the floor. The floor exerts a reaction force forward on the professor that causes her to accelerate
      forward. Similarly, a car accelerates because the ground pushes forward on the drive wheels in reaction to the drive
      wheels pushing backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a
      gravel road and throw rocks backward. In another example, rockets move forward by expelling gas backward at high
      velocity. This means the rocket exerts a large backward force on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber, and the
      gas therefore exerts a large reaction force forward on the rocket. This reaction force is called thrust. It is a common
      misconception that rockets propel themselves by pushing on the ground or on the air behind them. They actually
      work better in a vacuum, where they can more readily expel the exhaust gases. Helicopters similarly create lift by
      pushing air down, thereby experiencing an upward reaction force. Birds and airplanes also fly by exerting force on air
      in a direction opposite to that of whatever force they need. For example, the wings of a bird force air downward and
      backward in order to get lift and move forward. An octopus propels itself in the water by ejecting water through a
      funnel from its body, similar to a jet ski. Boxers and other martial arts fighters experience reaction forces when they
      punch, sometimes breaking their hand by hitting an opponent’s body.

        EXAMPLE 4.3

Getting Up To Speed: Choosing the Correct System
A physics professor pushes a cart of demonstration equipment to a lecture hall, as seen in Figure 4.10. Her mass is
65.0 kg, the cart’s is 12.0 kg, and the equipment’s is 7.0 kg. Calculate the acceleration produced when the professor
exerts a backward force of 150 N on the floor. All forces opposing the motion, such as friction on the cart’s wheels
and air resistance, total 24.0 N.




FIGURE 4.10 A professor pushes a cart of demonstration equipment. The lengths of the arrows are proportional to the magnitudes of the
forces (except for , since it is too small to draw to scale). Different questions are asked in each example; thus, the system of interest must
be defined differently for each. System 1 is appropriate for this example, since it asks for the acceleration of the entire group of objects.
Only       and are external forces acting on System 1 along the line of motion. All other forces either cancel or act on the outside world.
System 2 is chosen for Example 4.4 so that           will be an external force and enter into Newton’s second law. Note that the free-body
diagrams, which allow us to apply Newton’s second law, vary with the system chosen.

Strategy

Since they accelerate as a unit, we define the system to be the professor, cart, and equipment. This is System 1 in
Figure 4.10. The professor pushes backward with a force            of 150 N. According to Newton’s third law, the floor
exerts a forward reaction force          of 150 N on System 1. Because all motion is horizontal, we can assume there
is no net force in the vertical direction. The problem is therefore one-dimensional along the horizontal direction. As
noted, opposes the motion and is thus in the opposite direction of            . Note that we do not include the forces
      or       because these are internal forces, and we do not include          because it acts on the floor, not on the
system. There are no other significant forces acting on System 1. If the net external force can be found from all this
information, we can use Newton’s second law to find the acceleration as requested. See the free-body diagram in
the figure.

Solution

Newton’s second law is given by

                                                                                                                                        4.18

The net external force on System 1 is deduced from Figure 4.10 and the discussion above to be
                                                                                                                                        4.19

      Discussion

      None of the forces between components of System 1, such as between the professor’s hands and the cart,
      contribute to the net external force because they are internal to System 1. Another way to look at this is to note that
      forces between components of a system cancel because they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For
      example, the force exerted by the professor on the cart results in an equal and opposite force back on her. In this
      case both forces act on the same system and, therefore, cancel. Thus internal forces (between components of a
      system) cancel. Choosing System 1 was crucial to solving this problem.



              EXAMPLE 4.4

      Force on the Cart—Choosing a New System
      Calculate the force the professor exerts on the cart in Figure 4.10 using data from the previous example if needed.

      Strategy

      If we now define the system of interest to be the cart plus equipment (System 2 in Figure 4.10), then the net
      external force on System 2 is the force the professor exerts on the cart minus friction. The force she exerts on the
      cart,      , is an external force acting on System 2.     was internal to System 1, but it is external to System 2 and
      will enter Newton’s second law for System 2.

      Solution

      Newton’s second law can be used to find             . Starting with

                                                                                                                       4.22

      and noting that the magnitude of the net external force on System 2 is

                                                                                                                       4.23

      we solve for        , the desired quantity:

                                                                                                                       4.24

      The value of is given, so we must calculate net  . That can be done since both the acceleration and mass of
      System 2 are known. Using Newton’s second law we see that
                                                                                                                       4.25
      where the mass of System 2 is 19.0 kg ( = 12.0 kg + 7.0 kg) and its acceleration was found to be                  in
      the previous example. Thus,
                                                                                                                       4.26
                                                                                                                       4.27

      Now we can find the desired force:

                                                                                                                       4.28

                                                                                                                       4.29

Discussion

It is interesting that this force is significantly less than the 150-N force the professor exerted backward on the floor.
Not all of that 150-N force is transmitted to the cart; some of it accelerates the professor.

The choice of a system is an important analytical step both in solving problems and in thoroughly understanding the
physics of the situation (which is not necessarily the same thing).

4.5 Normal, Tension, and Other Examples of Forces
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define normal and tension forces.
 • Apply Newton's laws of motion to solve problems involving a variety of forces.
 • Use trigonometric identities to resolve weight into components.

Forces are given many names, such as push, pull, thrust, lift, weight, friction, and tension. Traditionally, forces have
been grouped into several categories and given names relating to their source, how they are transmitted, or their
effects. The most important of these categories are discussed in this section, together with some interesting
applications. Further examples of forces are discussed later in this text.

Normal Force
Weight (also called force of gravity) is a pervasive force that acts at all times and must be counteracted to keep an
object from falling. You definitely notice that you must support the weight of a heavy object by pushing up on it when
you hold it stationary, as illustrated in Figure 4.11(a). But how do inanimate objects like a table support the weight
of a mass placed on them, such as shown in Figure 4.11(b)? When the bag of dog food is placed on the table, the
table actually sags slightly under the load. This would be noticeable if the load were placed on a card table, but even
rigid objects deform when a force is applied to them. Unless the object is deformed beyond its limit, it will exert a
restoring force much like a deformed spring (or trampoline or diving board). The greater the deformation, the greater
the restoring force. So when the load is placed on the table, the table sags until the restoring force becomes as large
as the weight of the load. At this point the net external force on the load is zero. That is the situation when the load
is stationary on the table. The table sags quickly, and the sag is slight so we do not notice it. But it is similar to the
sagging of a trampoline when you climb onto it.
162   4 • Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion




      FIGURE 4.11 (a) The person holding the bag of dog food must supply an upward force            equal in magnitude and opposite in direction
      to the weight of the food . (b) The card table sags when the dog food is placed on it, much like a stiff trampoline. Elastic restoring forces in
      the table grow as it sags until they supply a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the load.

      We must conclude that whatever supports a load, be it animate or not, must supply an upward force equal to the
      weight of the load, as we assumed in a few of the previous examples. If the force supporting a load is perpendicular
      to the surface of contact between the load and its support, this force is defined to be a normal force and here is
      given the symbol . (This is not the unit for force N.) The word normal means perpendicular to a surface. The normal
      force can be less than the object’s weight if the object is on an incline, as you will see in the next example.


        Common Misconception: Normal Force (N) vs. Newton (N)
        In this section we have introduced the quantity normal force, which is represented by the variable . This
        should not be confused with the symbol for the newton, which is also represented by the letter N. These
        symbols are particularly important to distinguish because the units of a normal force ( ) happen to be newtons
        (N). For example, the normal force that the floor exerts on a chair might be                 . One important
        difference is that normal force is a vector, while the newton is simply a unit. Be careful not to confuse these
        letters in your calculations! You will encounter more similarities among variables and units as you proceed in
        physics. Another example of this is the quantity work ( ) and the unit watts (W).



              EXAMPLE 4.5

      Weight on an Incline, a Two-Dimensional Problem
      Consider the skier on a slope shown in Figure 4.12. Her mass including equipment is 60.0 kg. (a) What is her
      acceleration if friction is negligible? (b) What is her acceleration if friction is known to be 45.0 N?

FIGURE 4.12 Since motion and friction are parallel to the slope, it is most convenient to project all forces onto a coordinate system where
one axis is parallel to the slope and the other is perpendicular (axes shown to left of skier). is perpendicular to the slope and f is parallel
to the slope, but has components along both axes, namely               and   . is equal in magnitude to      , so that there is no motion
perpendicular to the slope, but is less than        , so that there is a downslope acceleration (along the parallel axis).

Strategy

This is a two-dimensional problem, since the forces on the skier (the system of interest) are not parallel. The
approach we have used in two-dimensional kinematics also works very well here. Choose a convenient coordinate
system and project the vectors onto its axes, creating two connected one-dimensional problems to solve. The most
convenient coordinate system for motion on an incline is one that has one coordinate parallel to the slope and one
perpendicular to the slope. (Remember that motions along mutually perpendicular axes are independent.) We use
the symbols and to represent perpendicular and parallel, respectively. This choice of axes simplifies this type of
problem, because there is no motion perpendicular to the slope and because friction is always parallel to the
surface between two objects. The only external forces acting on the system are the skier’s weight, friction, and the
support of the slope, respectively labeled , , and in Figure 4.12. is always perpendicular to the slope, and is
parallel to it. But is not in the direction of either axis, and so the first step we take is to project it into components
along the chosen axes, defining       to be the component of weight parallel to the slope and           the component of
weight perpendicular to the slope. Once this is done, we can consider the two separate problems of forces parallel
to the slope and forces perpendicular to the slope.

Solution

The magnitude of the component of the weight parallel to the slope is                                                            , and the
magnitude of the component of the weight perpendicular to the slope is                                                               .

(a) Neglecting friction. Since the acceleration is parallel to the slope, we need only consider forces parallel to the
slope. (Forces perpendicular to the slope add to zero, since there is no acceleration in that direction.) The forces
parallel to the slope are the amount of the skier’s weight parallel to the slope     and friction . Using Newton’s
second law, with subscripts to denote quantities parallel to the slope,

                                                                                                                                         4.30

where                                      , assuming no friction for this part, so that

                                                                                                                                         4.31

                                                                                                                                         4.32

is the acceleration.

(b) Including friction. We now have a given value for friction, and we know its direction is parallel to the slope and it
opposes motion between surfaces in contact. So the net external force is now

                                                                                                                                         4.33

      and substituting this into Newton’s second law,                     , gives

                                                                                                                               4.34

      which yields

                                                                                                                               4.36

      which is the acceleration parallel to the incline when there is 45.0 N of opposing friction.

      Discussion

      Since friction always opposes motion between surfaces, the acceleration is smaller when there is friction than when
      there is none. In fact, it is a general result that if friction on an incline is negligible, then the acceleration down the
      incline is           , regardless of mass. This is related to the previously discussed fact that all objects fall with the
      same acceleration in the absence of air resistance. Similarly, all objects, regardless of mass, slide down a frictionless
      incline with the same acceleration (if the angle is the same).



        Resolving Weight into Components




                               FIGURE 4.13 An object rests on an incline that makes an angle θ with the horizontal.

        When an object rests on an incline that makes an angle with the horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the
        object is divided into two components: a force acting perpendicular to the plane,      , and a force acting parallel
        to the plane,    . The perpendicular force of weight,   , is typically equal in magnitude and opposite in
        direction to the normal force,     . The force acting parallel to the plane,         , causes the object to accelerate down
        the incline. The force of friction, , opposes the motion of the object, so it acts upward along the plane.

        It is important to be careful when resolving the weight of the object into components. If the angle of the incline
        is at an angle to the horizontal, then the magnitudes of the weight components are

                                                                                                                             4.37

        and
                                                                                                                             4.38
        Instead of memorizing these equations, it is helpful to be able to determine them from reason. To do this, draw
        the right triangle formed by the three weight vectors. Notice that the angle of the incline is the same as the
        angle formed between and           . Knowing this property, you can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude
        of the weight components:

  Take-Home Experiment: Force Parallel
  To investigate how a force parallel to an inclined plane changes, find a rubber band, some objects to hang from
  the end of the rubber band, and a board you can position at different angles. How much does the rubber band
  stretch when you hang the object from the end of the board? Now place the board at an angle so that the object
  slides off when placed on the board. How much does the rubber band extend if it is lined up parallel to the board
  and used to hold the object stationary on the board? Try two more angles. What does this show?


Tension
A tension is a force along the length of a medium, especially a force carried by a flexible medium, such as a rope or
cable. The word “tension” comes from a Latin word meaning “to stretch.” Not coincidentally, the flexible cords that
carry muscle forces to other parts of the body are called tendons. Any flexible connector, such as a string, rope,
chain, wire, or cable, can exert pulls only parallel to its length; thus, a force carried by a flexible connector is a
tension with direction parallel to the connector. It is important to understand that tension is a pull in a connector. In
contrast, consider the phrase: “You can’t push a rope.” The tension force pulls outward along the two ends of a rope.

Consider a person holding a mass on a rope as shown in Figure 4.14.




FIGURE 4.14 When a perfectly flexible connector (one requiring no force to bend it) such as this rope transmits a force , that force must
be parallel to the length of the rope, as shown. The pull such a flexible connector exerts is a tension. Note that the rope pulls with equal
force but in opposite directions on the hand and the supported mass (neglecting the weight of the rope). This is an example of Newton’s
third law. The rope is the medium that carries the equal and opposite forces between the two objects. The tension anywhere in the rope
between the hand and the mass is equal. Once you have determined the tension in one location, you have determined the tension at all
locations along the rope.

Tension in the rope must equal the weight of the supported mass, as we can prove using Newton’s second law. If the
5.00-kg mass in the figure is stationary, then its acceleration is zero, and thus    . The only external forces
acting on the mass are its weight and the tension supplied by the rope. Thus,
                                                                                                                                       4.41
where      and     are the magnitudes of the tension and weight and their signs indicate direction, with up being
166   4 • Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion



      positive here. Thus, just as you would expect, the tension equals the weight of the supported mass:
                                                                                                                                            4.42
      For a 5.00-kg mass, then (neglecting the mass of the rope) we see that

                                                                                                                                            4.43

      If we cut the rope and insert a spring, the spring would extend a length corresponding to a force of 49.0 N, providing
      a direct observation and measure of the tension force in the rope.

      Flexible connectors are often used to transmit forces around corners, such as in a hospital traction system, a finger
      joint, or a bicycle brake cable. If there is no friction, the tension is transmitted undiminished. Only its direction
      changes, and it is always parallel to the flexible connector. This is illustrated in Figure 4.15 (a) and (b).




      FIGURE 4.15 (a) Tendons in the finger carry force from the muscles to other parts of the finger, usually changing the force’s direction, but
      not its magnitude (the tendons are relatively friction free). (b) The brake cable on a bicycle carries the tension from the handlebars to the
      brake mechanism. Again, the direction but not the magnitude of is changed.

Strategy

As you can see in the figure, the wire is not perfectly horizontal (it cannot be!), but is bent under the person’s weight.
Thus, the tension on either side of the person has an upward component that can support his weight. As usual,
forces are vectors represented pictorially by arrows having the same directions as the forces and lengths
proportional to their magnitudes. The system is the tightrope walker, and the only external forces acting on him are
his weight and the two tensions          (left tension) and     (right tension), as illustrated. It is reasonable to neglect
the weight of the wire itself. The net external force is zero since the system is stationary. A little trigonometry can
now be used to find the tensions. One conclusion is possible at the outset—we can see from part (b) of the figure
that the magnitudes of the tensions        and     must be equal. This is because there is no horizontal acceleration in
the rope, and the only forces acting to the left and right are      and    . Thus, the magnitude of those forces must be
equal so that they cancel each other out.

Whenever we have two-dimensional vector problems in which no two vectors are parallel, the easiest method of
solution is to pick a convenient coordinate system and project the vectors onto its axes. In this case the best
coordinate system has one axis horizontal and the other vertical. We call the horizontal the -axis and the vertical
the -axis.

Solution

First, we need to resolve the tension vectors into their horizontal and vertical components. It helps to draw a new
free-body diagram showing all of the horizontal and vertical components of each force acting on the system.




FIGURE 4.17 When the vectors are projected onto vertical and horizontal axes, their components along those axes must add to zero, since
the tightrope walker is stationary. The small angle results in being much greater than .

Consider the horizontal components of the forces (denoted with a subscript ):

Now, observe Figure 4.17. You can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude of                      and      . Notice that:

      as predicted. Now, considering the vertical components (denoted by a subscript ), we can solve for . Again, since
      the person is stationary, Newton’s second law implies that net      . Thus, as illustrated in the free-body diagram
      in Figure 4.17,

                                                                                                                            4.49

      Observing Figure 4.17, we can use trigonometry to determine the relationship between            ,     , and     . As we
      determined from the analysis in the horizontal direction,                 :




                                                                                                                            4.50




      Now, we can substitute the values for       and      , into the net force equation in the vertical direction:

      and the tension is
                                                                                                                            4.54
      Discussion

      Note that the vertical tension in the wire acts as a normal force that supports the weight of the tightrope walker. The
      tension is almost six times the 686-N weight of the tightrope walker. Since the wire is nearly horizontal, the vertical
      component of its tension is only a small fraction of the tension in the wire. The large horizontal components are in
      opposite directions and cancel, and so most of the tension in the wire is not used to support the weight of the
      tightrope walker.


      If we wish to create a very large tension, all we have to do is exert a force perpendicular to a flexible connector, as
      illustrated in Figure 4.18. As we saw in the last example, the weight of the tightrope walker acted as a force
      perpendicular to the rope. We saw that the tension in the roped related to the weight of the tightrope walker in the
      following way:

                                                                                                                            4.55

      We can extend this expression to describe the tension       created when a perpendicular force (      ) is exerted at the
      middle of a flexible connector:

                                                                                                                            4.56

      Note that is the angle between the horizontal and the bent connector. In this case, becomes very large as
      approaches zero. Even the relatively small weight of any flexible connector will cause it to sag, since an infinite

tension would result if it were horizontal (i.e.,              and               ). (See Figure 4.18.)




FIGURE 4.18 We can create a very large tension in the chain by pushing on it perpendicular to its length, as shown. Suppose we wish to pull
a car out of the mud when no tow truck is available. Each time the car moves forward, the chain is tightened to keep it as nearly straight as
possible. The tension in the chain is given by             ; since   is small,   is very large. This situation is analogous to the tightrope
walker shown in Figure 4.16, except that the tensions shown here are those transmitted to the car and the tree rather than those acting at
the point where    is applied.




FIGURE 4.19 Unless an infinite tension is exerted, any flexible connector—such as the chain at the bottom of the picture—will sag under its
own weight, giving a characteristic curve when the weight is evenly distributed along the length. Suspension bridges—such as the Golden
Gate Bridge shown in this image—are essentially very heavy flexible connectors. The weight of the bridge is evenly distributed along the
length of flexible connectors, usually cables, which take on the characteristic shape. (credit: Leaflet, Wikimedia Commons)

Extended Topic: Real Forces and Inertial Frames
There is another distinction among forces in addition to the types already mentioned. Some forces are real, whereas
others are not. Real forces are those that have some physical origin, such as the gravitational pull. Contrastingly,
fictitious forces are those that arise simply because an observer is in an accelerating frame of reference, such as one
that rotates (like a merry-go-round) or undergoes linear acceleration (like a car slowing down). For example, if a
satellite is heading due north above Earth’s northern hemisphere, then to an observer on Earth it will appear to
experience a force to the west that has no physical origin. Of course, what is happening here is that Earth is rotating
toward the east and moves east under the satellite. In Earth’s frame this looks like a westward force on the satellite,
or it can be interpreted as a violation of Newton’s first law (the law of inertia). An inertial frame of reference is one
in which all forces are real and, equivalently, one in which Newton’s laws have the simple forms given in this chapter.

Earth’s rotation is slow enough that Earth is nearly an inertial frame. You ordinarily must perform precise
experiments to observe fictitious forces and the slight departures from Newton’s laws, such as the effect just
described. On the large scale, such as for the rotation of weather systems and ocean currents, the effects can be
easily observed.

The crucial factor in determining whether a frame of reference is inertial is whether it accelerates or rotates relative
to a known inertial frame. Unless stated otherwise, all phenomena discussed in this text are considered in inertial
frames.

All the forces discussed in this section are real forces, but there are a number of other real forces, such as lift and
thrust, that are not discussed in this section. They are more specialized, and it is not necessary to discuss every type
of force. It is natural, however, to ask where the basic simplicity we seek to find in physics is in the long list of forces.
Are some more basic than others? Are some different manifestations of the same underlying force? The answer to
170   4 • Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion



      both questions is yes, as will be seen in the next (extended) section and in the treatment of modern physics later in
      the text.

      4.6 Problem-Solving Strategies
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Understand and apply a problem-solving procedure to solve problems using Newton's laws of motion.

      Success in problem solving is obviously necessary to understand and apply physical principles, not to mention the
      more immediate need of passing exams. The basics of problem solving, presented earlier in this text, are followed
      here, but specific strategies useful in applying Newton’s laws of motion are emphasized. These techniques also
      reinforce concepts that are useful in many other areas of physics. Many problem-solving strategies are stated
      outright in the worked examples, and so the following techniques should reinforce skills you have already begun to
      develop.

      Problem-Solving Strategy for Newton’s Laws of Motion
      Step 1. As usual, it is first necessary to identify the physical principles involved. Once it is determined that Newton’s
      laws of motion are involved (if the problem involves forces), it is particularly important to draw a careful sketch of
      the situation. Such a sketch is shown in Figure 4.20(a). Then, as in Figure 4.20(b), use arrows to represent all forces,
      label them carefully, and make their lengths and directions correspond to the forces they represent (whenever
      sufficient information exists).

FIGURE 4.20 (a) A sketch of Tarzan hanging from a vine. (b) Arrows are used to represent all forces. is the tension in the vine above
Tarzan,     is the force he exerts on the vine, and is his weight. All other forces, such as the nudge of a breeze, are assumed negligible. (c)
Suppose we are given the ape man’s mass and asked to find the tension in the vine. We then define the system of interest as shown and
draw a free-body diagram.       is no longer shown, because it is not a force acting on the system of interest; rather,     acts on the outside
world. (d) Showing only the arrows, the head-to-tail method of addition is used. It is apparent that           , if Tarzan is stationary.

Step 2. Identify what needs to be determined and what is known or can be inferred from the problem as stated. That
is, make a list of knowns and unknowns. Then carefully determine the system of interest. This decision is a crucial
step, since Newton’s second law involves only external forces. Once the system of interest has been identified, it
becomes possible to determine which forces are external and which are internal, a necessary step to employ
Newton’s second law. (See Figure 4.20(c).) Newton’s third law may be used to identify whether forces are exerted
between components of a system (internal) or between the system and something outside (external). As illustrated
earlier in this chapter, the system of interest depends on what question we need to answer. This choice becomes
easier with practice, eventually developing into an almost unconscious process. Skill in clearly defining systems will
be beneficial in later chapters as well.

A diagram showing the system of interest and all of the external forces is called a free-body diagram. Only forces
are shown on free-body diagrams, not acceleration or velocity. We have drawn several of these in worked examples.
Figure 4.20(c) shows a free-body diagram for the system of interest. Note that no internal forces are shown in a
free-body diagram.

Step 3. Once a free-body diagram is drawn, Newton’s second law can be applied to solve the problem. This is done
in Figure 4.20(d) for a particular situation. In general, once external forces are clearly identified in free-body
diagrams, it should be a straightforward task to put them into equation form and solve for the unknown, as done in
all previous examples. If the problem is one-dimensional—that is, if all forces are parallel—then they add like
scalars. If the problem is two-dimensional, then it must be broken down into a pair of one-dimensional problems.
This is done by projecting the force vectors onto a set of axes chosen for convenience. As seen in previous
examples, the choice of axes can simplify the problem. For example, when an incline is involved, a set of axes with
one axis parallel to the incline and one perpendicular to it is most convenient. It is almost always convenient to
make one axis parallel to the direction of motion, if this is known.
172   4 • Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion




        Applying Newton’s Second Law
        Before you write net force equations, it is critical to determine whether the system is accelerating in a particular
        direction. If the acceleration is zero in a particular direction, then the net force is zero in that direction. Similarly,
        if the acceleration is nonzero in a particular direction, then the net force is described by the equation:
                    .

        For example, if the system is accelerating in the horizontal direction, but it is not accelerating in the vertical
        direction, then you will have the following conclusions:
                                                                                                                                         4.57
                                                                                                                                         4.58

        You will need this information in order to determine unknown forces acting in a system.


      Step 4. As always, check the solution to see whether it is reasonable. In some cases, this is obvious. For example, it
      is reasonable to find that friction causes an object to slide down an incline more slowly than when no friction exists.
      In practice, intuition develops gradually through problem solving, and with experience it becomes progressively
      easier to judge whether an answer is reasonable. Another way to check your solution is to check the units. If you are
      solving for force and end up with units of m/s, then you have made a mistake.

      4.7 Further Applications of Newton’s Laws of Motion
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Apply problem-solving techniques to solve for quantities in more complex systems of forces.
       • Integrate concepts from kinematics to solve problems using Newton's laws of motion.

      There are many interesting applications of Newton’s laws of motion, a few more of which are presented in this
      section. These serve also to illustrate some further subtleties of physics and to help build problem-solving skills.


              EXAMPLE 4.7

      Drag Force on a Barge
      Suppose two tugboats push on a barge at different angles, as shown in Figure 4.21. The first tugboat exerts a force
      of            in the x-direction, and the second tugboat exerts a force of            in the y-direction.




      FIGURE 4.21 (a) A view from above of two tugboats pushing on a barge. (b) The free-body diagram for the ship contains only forces acting
      in the plane of the water. It omits the two vertical forces—the weight of the barge and the buoyant force of the water supporting it cancel
      and are not shown. Since the applied forces are perpendicular, the x- and y-axes are in the same direction as          and  . The problem
      quickly becomes a one-dimensional problem along the direction of           , since friction is in the direction opposite to   .

      If the mass of the barge is                     and its acceleration is observed to be                              in the direction



      Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                         4.7 • Further Applications of Newton’s Laws of Motion   173



shown, what is the drag force of the water on the barge resisting the motion? (Note: drag force is a frictional force
exerted by fluids, such as air or water. The drag force opposes the motion of the object.)

Strategy

The directions and magnitudes of acceleration and the applied forces are given in Figure 4.21(a). We will define the
total force of the tugboats on the barge as    so that:

                                                                                                                       4.59

Since the barge is flat bottomed, the drag of the water        will be in the direction opposite to      , as shown in the
free-body diagram in Figure 4.21(b). The system of interest here is the barge, since the forces on it are given as well
as its acceleration. Our strategy is to find the magnitude and direction of the net applied force     , and then apply
Newton’s second law to solve for the drag force        .

Solution

Since      and     are perpendicular, the magnitude and direction of          are easily found. First, the resultant
magnitude is given by the Pythagorean theorem:


                                                                                                                       4.60


The angle is given by


                                                                                                                       4.61


which we know, because of Newton’s first law, is the same direction as the acceleration.      is in the opposite
direction of   , since it acts to slow down the acceleration. Therefore, the net external force is in the same
direction as       , but its magnitude is slightly less than     . The problem is now one-dimensional. From Figure
4.21(b), we can see that

                                                                                                                       4.62

But Newton’s second law states that
                                                                                                                       4.63
Thus,

                                                                                                                       4.64

This can be solved for the magnitude of the drag force of the water         in terms of known quantities:

                                                                                                                       4.65

Substituting known values gives

                                                                                                                       4.66

The direction of      has already been determined to be in the direction opposite to          , or at an angle of      south
of west.

Discussion

The numbers used in this example are reasonable for a moderately large barge. It is certainly difficult to obtain
larger accelerations with tugboats, and small speeds are desirable to avoid running the barge into the docks. Drag is
relatively small for a well-designed hull at low speeds, consistent with the answer to this example, where      is less
than 1/600th of the weight of the ship.
174   4 • Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion



      In the earlier example of a tightrope walker we noted that the tensions in wires supporting a mass were equal only
      because the angles on either side were equal. Consider the following example, where the angles are not equal;
      slightly more trigonometry is involved.


              EXAMPLE 4.8

      Different Tensions at Different Angles
      Consider the traffic light (mass 15.0 kg) suspended from two wires as shown in Figure 4.22. Find the tension in each
      wire, neglecting the masses of the wires.

Strategy

The system of interest is the traffic light, and its free-body diagram is shown in Figure 4.22(c). The three forces
involved are not parallel, and so they must be projected onto a coordinate system. The most convenient coordinate
system has one axis vertical and one horizontal, and the vector projections on it are shown in part (d) of the figure.
There are two unknowns in this problem ( and ), so two equations are needed to find them. These two
equations come from applying Newton’s second law along the vertical and horizontal axes, noting that the net
external force is zero along each axis because acceleration is zero.

Solution

First consider the horizontal or x-axis:
                                                                                                                    4.67
Thus, as you might expect,
                                                                                                                    4.68
This gives us the following relationship between     and     :
                                                                                                                    4.69
Thus,
                                                                                                                    4.70
Note that   and     are not equal in this case, because the angles on either side are not equal. It is reasonable that
   ends up being greater than , because it is exerted more vertically than .

Now consider the force components along the vertical or y-axis:

                                                                                                                    4.71

This implies

                                                                                                                    4.72

Substituting the expressions for the vertical components gives
                                                                                                                    4.73
There are two unknowns in this equation, but substituting the expression for       in terms of    reduces this to one
equation with one unknown:
                                                                                                                    4.74
which yields

                                                                                                                    4.75

Solving this last equation gives the magnitude of    to be
                                                                                                                    4.76
Finally, the magnitude of     is determined using the relationship between them,       = 1.225     , found above. Thus
we obtain
                                                                                                                    4.77

Discussion

Both tensions would be larger if both wires were more horizontal, and they will be equal if and only if the angles on
either side are the same (as they were in the earlier example of a tightrope walker).


The bathroom scale is an excellent example of a normal force acting on a body. It provides a quantitative reading of
how much it must push upward to support the weight of an object. But can you predict what you would see on the
176   4 • Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion



      dial of a bathroom scale if you stood on it during an elevator ride? Will you see a value greater than your weight
      when the elevator starts up? What about when the elevator moves upward at a constant speed: will the scale still
      read more than your weight at rest? Consider the following example.


              EXAMPLE 4.9

      What Does the Bathroom Scale Read in an Elevator?
      Figure 4.23 shows a 75.0-kg man (weight of about 165 lb) standing on a bathroom scale in an elevator. Calculate the
      scale reading: (a) if the elevator accelerates upward at a rate of      , and (b) if the elevator moves upward at a
      constant speed of 1 m/s.

          is the weight of the elevator,    is the force of the scale on the person, is the force of the person on the scale, is the force of the
      scale on the floor of the elevator, and is the force of the floor upward on the scale. (b) The free-body diagram shows only the external
      forces acting on the designated system of interest—the person.

      Strategy

      If the scale is accurate, its reading will equal         , the magnitude of the force the person exerts downward on it.
      Figure 4.23(a) shows the numerous forces acting on the elevator, scale, and person. It makes this one-dimensional
      problem look much more formidable than if the person is chosen to be the system of interest and a free-body
      diagram is drawn as in Figure 4.23(b). Analysis of the free-body diagram using Newton’s laws can produce answers
      to both parts (a) and (b) of this example, as well as some other questions that might arise. The only forces acting on
      the person are his weight and the upward force of the scale . According to Newton’s third law            and    are
      equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so that we need to find                  in order to find what the scale reads. We
      can do this, as usual, by applying Newton’s second law,
                                                                                                                                           4.78

No assumptions were made about the acceleration, and so this solution should be valid for a variety of accelerations
in addition to the ones in this exercise.

Solution for (a)

In this part of the problem,               , so that

                                                                                                                   4.82

yielding
                                                                                                                   4.83

Discussion for (a)

This is about 185 lb. What would the scale have read if he were stationary? Since his acceleration would be zero, the
force of the scale would be equal to his weight:



                                                                                                                   4.84



So, the scale reading in the elevator is greater than his 735-N (165 lb) weight. This means that the scale is pushing
up on the person with a force greater than his weight, as it must in order to accelerate him upward. Clearly, the
greater the acceleration of the elevator, the greater the scale reading, consistent with what you feel in rapidly
accelerating versus slowly accelerating elevators.

Solution for (b)

Now, what happens when the elevator reaches a constant upward velocity? Will the scale still read more than his
weight? For any constant velocity—up, down, or stationary—acceleration is zero because          , and       .

Thus,
                                                                                                                   4.85
Now

                                                                                                                   4.86

which gives
                                                                                                                   4.87

Discussion for (b)

The scale reading is 735 N, which equals the person’s weight. This will be the case whenever the elevator has a
constant velocity—moving up, moving down, or stationary.


The solution to the previous example also applies to an elevator accelerating downward, as mentioned. When an
elevator accelerates downward, is negative, and the scale reading is less than the weight of the person, until a
constant downward velocity is reached, at which time the scale reading again becomes equal to the person’s weight.
If the elevator is in free-fall and accelerating downward at , then the scale reading will be zero and the person will
appear to be weightless.

      Integrating Concepts: Newton’s Laws of Motion and Kinematics
      Physics is most interesting and most powerful when applied to general situations that involve more than a narrow
      set of physical principles. Newton’s laws of motion can also be integrated with other concepts that have been
      discussed previously in this text to solve problems of motion. For example, forces produce accelerations, a topic of
      kinematics, and hence the relevance of earlier chapters. When approaching problems that involve various types of
      forces, acceleration, velocity, and/or position, use the following steps to approach the problem:

      Problem-Solving Strategy

      Step 1. Identify which physical principles are involved. Listing the givens and the quantities to be calculated will
      allow you to identify the principles involved.
      Step 2. Solve the problem using strategies outlined in the text. If these are available for the specific topic, you
      should refer to them. You should also refer to the sections of the text that deal with a particular topic. The following
      worked example illustrates how these strategies are applied to an integrated concept problem.


              EXAMPLE 4.10

      What Force Must a Soccer Player Exert to Reach Top Speed?
      A soccer player starts from rest and accelerates forward, reaching a velocity of 8.00 m/s in 2.50 s. (a) What was his
      average acceleration? (b) What average force did he exert backward on the ground to achieve this acceleration? The
      player’s mass is 70.0 kg, and air resistance is negligible.

      Strategy

      1. To solve an integrated concept problem, we must first identify the physical principles involved and identify the
         chapters in which they are found. Part (a) of this example considers acceleration along a straight line. This is a
         topic of kinematics. Part (b) deals with force, a topic of dynamics found in this chapter.
      2. The following solutions to each part of the example illustrate how the specific problem-solving strategies are
         applied. These involve identifying knowns and unknowns, checking to see if the answer is reasonable, and so
         forth.

      Solution for (a)

      We are given the initial and final velocities (zero and 8.00 m/s forward); thus, the change in velocity is
                      . We are given the elapsed time, and so               . The unknown is acceleration, which can be
      found from its definition:

                                                                                                                        4.88

      Substituting the known values yields


                                                                                                                        4.89


      Discussion for (a)

      This is an attainable acceleration for an athlete in good condition.

      Solution for (b)

      Here we are asked to find the average force the player exerts backward to achieve this forward acceleration.
      Neglecting air resistance, this would be equal in magnitude to the net external force on the player, since this force
      causes his acceleration. Since we now know the player’s acceleration and are given his mass, we can use Newton’s
      second law to find the force exerted. That is,
                                                                                                                        4.90
      Substituting the known values of     and   gives

Discussion for (b)

This is about 50 pounds, a reasonable average force.

This worked example illustrates how to apply problem-solving strategies to situations that include topics from
different chapters. The first step is to identify the physical principles involved in the problem. The second step is to
solve for the unknown using familiar problem-solving strategies. These strategies are found throughout the text, and
many worked examples show how to use them for single topics. You will find these techniques for integrated
concept problems useful in applications of physics outside of a physics course, such as in your profession, in other
science disciplines, and in everyday life. The following problems will build your skills in the broad application of
physical principles.


4.8 Extended Topic: The Four Basic Forces—An Introduction
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Understand the four basic forces that underlie the processes in nature.

One of the most remarkable simplifications in physics is that only four distinct forces account for all known
phenomena. In fact, nearly all of the forces we experience directly are due to only one basic force, called the
electromagnetic force. (The gravitational force is the only force we experience directly that is not electromagnetic.)
This is a tremendous simplification of the myriad of apparently different forces we can list, only a few of which were
discussed in the previous section. As we will see, the basic forces are all thought to act through the exchange of
microscopic carrier particles, and the characteristics of the basic forces are determined by the types of particles
exchanged. Action at a distance, such as the gravitational force of Earth on the Moon, is explained by the existence
of a force field rather than by “physical contact.”

The four basic forces are the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force, and the strong
nuclear force. Their properties are summarized in Table 4.1. Since the weak and strong nuclear forces act over an
extremely short range, the size of a nucleus or less, we do not experience them directly, although they are crucial to
the very structure of matter. These forces determine which nuclei are stable and which decay, and they are the basis
of the release of energy in certain nuclear reactions. Nuclear forces determine not only the stability of nuclei, but
also the relative abundance of elements in nature. The properties of the nucleus of an atom determine the number
of electrons it has and, thus, indirectly determine the chemistry of the atom. More will be said of all of these topics
in later chapters.


 Concept Connections: The Four Basic Forces
 The four basic forces will be encountered in more detail as you progress through the text. The gravitational force
 is defined in Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation, electric force in Electric Charge and Electric Field,
 magnetic force in Magnetism, and nuclear forces in Radioactivity and Nuclear Physics. On a macroscopic scale,
 electromagnetism and gravity are the basis for all forces. The nuclear forces are vital to the substructure of
 matter, but they are not directly experienced on the macroscopic scale.

      TABLE 4.1 Properties of the Four Basic Forces

      The gravitational force is surprisingly weak—it is only because gravity is always attractive that we notice it at all. Our
      weight is the gravitational force due to the entire Earth acting on us. On the very large scale, as in astronomical
      systems, the gravitational force is the dominant force determining the motions of moons, planets, stars, and
      galaxies. The gravitational force also affects the nature of space and time. As we shall see later in the study of
      general relativity, space is curved in the vicinity of very massive bodies, such as the Sun, and time actually slows
      down near massive bodies.

      Electromagnetic forces can be either attractive or repulsive. They are long-range forces, which act over extremely
      large distances, and they nearly cancel for macroscopic objects. (Remember that it is the net external force that is
      important.) If they did not cancel, electromagnetic forces would completely overwhelm the gravitational force. The
      electromagnetic force is a combination of electrical forces (such as those that cause static electricity) and magnetic
      forces (such as those that affect a compass needle). These two forces were thought to be quite distinct until early in
      the 19th century, when scientists began to discover that they are different manifestations of the same force. This
      discovery is a classical case of the unification of forces. Similarly, friction, tension, and all of the other classes of
      forces we experience directly (except gravity, of course) are due to electromagnetic interactions of atoms and
      molecules. It is still convenient to consider these forces separately in specific applications, however, because of the
      ways they manifest themselves.


        Concept Connections: Unifying Forces
        Attempts to unify the four basic forces are discussed in relation to elementary particles later in this text. By
        “unify” we mean finding connections between the forces that show that they are different manifestations of a
        single force. Even if such unification is achieved, the forces will retain their separate characteristics on the
        macroscopic scale and may be identical only under extreme conditions such as those existing in the early
        universe.


      Physicists are now exploring whether the four basic forces are in some way related. Attempts to unify all forces into
      one come under the rubric of Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), with which there has been some success in recent
      years. It is now known that under conditions of extremely high density and temperature, such as existed in the early
      universe, the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are indistinguishable. They can now be considered to be
      different manifestations of one force, called the electroweak force. So the list of four has been reduced in a sense to
      only three. Further progress in unifying all forces is proving difficult—especially the inclusion of the gravitational
      force, which has the special characteristics of affecting the space and time in which the other forces exist.

      While the unification of forces will not affect how we discuss forces in this text, it is fascinating that such underlying
      simplicity exists in the face of the overt complexity of the universe. There is no reason that nature must be simple—it
      simply is.



      1 The graviton is a proposed particle, though it has not yet been observed by scientists. See the discussion of gravitational waves later in
      this section. The particles   ,    , and     are called vector bosons; these were predicted by theory and first observed in 1983. There are
      eight types of gluons proposed by scientists, and their existence is indicated by meson exchange in the nuclei of atoms.

Action at a Distance: Concept of a Field
All forces act at a distance. This is obvious for the gravitational force. Earth and the Moon, for example, interact
without coming into contact. It is also true for all other forces. Friction, for example, is an electromagnetic force
between atoms that may not actually touch. What is it that carries forces between objects? One way to answer this
question is to imagine that a force field surrounds whatever object creates the force. A second object (often called a
test object) placed in this field will experience a force that is a function of location and other variables. The field
itself is the “thing” that carries the force from one object to another. The field is defined so as to be a characteristic
of the object creating it; the field does not depend on the test object placed in it. Earth’s gravitational field, for
example, is a function of the mass of Earth and the distance from its center, independent of the presence of other
masses. The concept of a field is useful because equations can be written for force fields surrounding objects (for
gravity, this yields          at Earth’s surface), and motions can be calculated from these equations. (See Figure
4.24.)




FIGURE 4.24 The electric force field between a positively charged particle and a negatively charged particle. When a positive test charge is
placed in the field, the charge will experience a force in the direction of the force field lines.


  Concept Connections: Force Fields
  The concept of a force field is also used in connection with electric charge and is presented in Electric Charge
  and Electric Field. It is also a useful idea for all the basic forces, as will be seen in Particle Physics. Fields help us
  to visualize forces and how they are transmitted, as well as to describe them with precision and to link forces
  with subatomic carrier particles.


The field concept has been applied very successfully; we can calculate motions and describe nature to high
precision using field equations. As useful as the field concept is, however, it leaves unanswered the question of what
carries the force. It has been proposed in recent decades, starting in 1935 with Hideki Yukawa’s (1907–1981) work
on the strong nuclear force, that all forces are transmitted by the exchange of elementary particles. We can visualize
particle exchange as analogous to macroscopic phenomena such as two people passing a basketball back and forth,
thereby exerting a repulsive force without touching one another. (See Figure 4.25.)
182   4 • Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion




      FIGURE 4.25 The exchange of masses resulting in repulsive forces. (a) The person throwing the basketball exerts a force       on it toward
      the other person and feels a reaction force   away from the second person. (b) The person catching the basketball exerts a force        on it
      to stop the ball and feels a reaction force  away from the first person. (c) The analogous exchange of a meson between a proton and a
      neutron carries the strong nuclear forces      and         between them. An attractive force can also be exerted by the exchange of a
      mass—if person 2 pulled the basketball away from the first person as he tried to retain it, then the force between them would be attractive.

      This idea of particle exchange deepens rather than contradicts field concepts. It is more satisfying philosophically to
      think of something physical actually moving between objects acting at a distance. Table 4.1 lists the exchange or
      carrier particles, both observed and proposed, that carry the four forces. But the real fruit of the particle-exchange
      proposal is that searches for Yukawa’s proposed particle found it and a number of others that were completely
      unexpected, stimulating yet more research. All of this research eventually led to the proposal of quarks as the
      underlying substructure of matter, which is a basic tenet of GUTs. If successful, these theories will explain not only
      forces, but also the structure of matter itself. Yet physics is an experimental science, so the test of these theories
      must lie in the domain of the real world. As of this writing, scientists at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland are
      starting to test these theories using the world’s largest particle accelerator: the Large Hadron Collider. This
      accelerator (27 km in circumference) allows two high-energy proton beams, traveling in opposite directions, to
      collide. An energy of 14 trillion electron volts will be available. It is anticipated that some new particles, possibly
      force carrier particles, will be found. (See Figure 4.26.) One of the force carriers of high interest that researchers
      hope to detect is the Higgs boson. The observation of its properties might tell us why different particles have
      different masses.

FIGURE 4.26 The world’s largest particle accelerator spans the border between Switzerland and France. Two beams, traveling in opposite
directions close to the speed of light, collide in a tube similar to the central tube shown here. External magnets determine the beam’s path.
Special detectors will analyze particles created in these collisions. Questions as broad as what is the origin of mass and what was matter
like the first few seconds of our universe will be explored. This accelerator began preliminary operation in 2008. (credit: Frank Hommes)

Tiny particles also have wave-like behavior, something we will explore more in a later chapter. To better understand
force-carrier particles from another perspective, let us consider gravity. The search for gravitational waves has been
going on for a number of years. Over 100 years ago, Einstein predicted the existence of these waves as part of his
general theory of relativity. Gravitational waves are created during the collision of massive stars, in black holes, or in
supernova explosions—like shock waves. These gravitational waves will travel through space from such sites much
like a pebble dropped into a pond sends out ripples—except these waves move at the speed of light. A detector
apparatus has been built in the U.S., consisting of two large installations nearly 3000 km apart—one in Washington
state and one in Louisiana! The facility is called the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).
Each installation is designed to use optical lasers to examine any slight shift in the relative positions of two masses
due to the effect of gravity waves. The two sites allow simultaneous measurements of these small effects to be
separated from other natural phenomena, such as earthquakes. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2002,
and work is proceeding on increasing their sensitivity. Similar installations have been built in Italy (VIRGO), Germany
(GEO600), and Japan (TAMA300) to provide a worldwide network of gravitational wave detectors.

In September, 2015, LIGO fulfilled its promise and helped prove Einstein's predictions. The system detected the
first gravitational waves arising from the merger of two black holes—one 29 times the mass of our Sun and the other
36 times the mass of our Sun—that occurred 1.3 billion years ago. About 3 times the mass of the Sun was converted
into gravitational waves in a fraction of a second—with a peak power output about 50 times that of the whole visible
universe. Due to the 7 millisecond delay in detection, researchers established that the merger occurred on the
southern hemisphere side of Earth. Since then, LIGO and VIRGO have combined to detect about a dozen similar
events, with better and more precise measurements. Waves from neutron star mergers and different-sized black
holes have deepened our understanding of these objects and their impact on the universe.

International collaboration in this area is moving into space with the joint EU/US project LISA (Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna). Earthquakes and other Earthly noises will be no problem for these monitoring spacecraft. LISA will
complement LIGO by looking at much more massive black holes through the observation of gravitational-wave
sources emitting much larger wavelengths. Three satellites will be placed in space above Earth in an equilateral
triangle (with 5,000,000-km sides) (Figure 4.27). The system will measure the relative positions of each satellite to
detect passing gravitational waves. Accuracy to within 10% of the size of an atom will be needed to detect any
waves. The launch of this project will likely be in the 2030s.

      satellite of LISA will consist of a laser source and a mass. The lasers will transmit a signal to measure the distance between each satellite’s
      test mass. The relative motion of these masses will provide information about passing gravitational waves. (credit: NASA)

      As you can see above, some of the most groundbreaking developments in physics are made with a relatively long
      gap from theoretical prediction to experimental detection. This pattern continues the process of science from its
      earliest days, where early thinkers and researchers made discoveries that only led to more questions. Einstein was
      unique in many ways, but he was not unique in that later scientists, building on his and each other's work, would
      prove his theories. Evidence for black holes became more and more concrete as scientists developed new and
      better ways to look for them. Some of the most prominent have been Roger Penrose, who developed new
      mathematical models related to black holes, as well as Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez, who independently used
      telescope observations to identify a region of our galaxy where a massive unseen gravity source (4 million times the
      size of our Sun) was pulling on stars. And soon after, collaborators on the Event Horizon Telescope project produced
      the first actual image of a black hole.

      powerful magnetic field that surrounds the object. The image was created by the Event Horizon Telescope, which combines data from
      telescopes around the world. The project involves over 200 researchers and produced the first image of a black hole in 2019. (credit: EHT

It is difficult to categorize forces into various types (aside from the four basic forces discussed in previous chapter).
We know that a net force affects the motion, position, and shape of an object. It is useful at this point to look at
some particularly interesting and common forces that will provide further applications of Newton’s laws of motion.

      5.1 Friction
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Discuss the general characteristics of friction.
       • Describe the various types of friction.
       • Calculate the magnitude of static and kinetic friction.

      Friction is a force that is around us all the time that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact but also
      allows us to move (which you have discovered if you have ever tried to walk on ice). While a common force, the
      behavior of friction is actually very complicated and is still not completely understood. We have to rely heavily on
      observations for whatever understandings we can gain. However, we can still deal with its more elementary general
      characteristics and understand the circumstances in which it behaves.


        Friction
        Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact.


      One of the simpler characteristics of friction is that it is parallel to the contact surface between surfaces and always
      in a direction that opposes motion or attempted motion of the systems relative to each other. If two surfaces are in
      contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction. For example,
      friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice. But when objects are stationary, static friction can act between them;
      the static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between the surfaces.


        Kinetic Friction
        If two surfaces are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic
        friction.


      Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floor—you may push harder and harder on the
      crate and not move it at all. This means that the static friction responds to what you do—it increases to be equal to
      and in the opposite direction of your push. But if you finally push hard enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and
      starts to move. Once in motion it is easier to keep it in motion than it was to get it started, indicating that the kinetic
      friction force is less than the static friction force. If you add mass to the crate, say by placing a box on top of it, you
      need to push even harder to get it started and also to keep it moving. Furthermore, if you oiled the concrete you
      would find it to be easier to get the crate started and keep it going (as you might expect).

      Figure 5.2 is a crude pictorial representation of how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Close-up
      inspection of these surfaces shows them to be rough. So when you push to get an object moving (in this case, a
      crate), you must raise the object until it can skip along with just the tips of the surface hitting, break off the points, or
      do both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. The harder the surfaces are
      pushed together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force is needed to move them. Part of the
      friction is due to adhesive forces between the surface molecules of the two objects, which explain the dependence
      of friction on the nature of the substances. Adhesion varies with substances in contact and is a complicated aspect
      of surface physics. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact (fewer molecules adhering), so less
      force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed.

FIGURE 5.2 Frictional forces, such as , always oppose motion or attempted motion between surfaces in contact. Friction arises in part
because of the roughness of the surfaces in contact, as seen in the expanded view. In order for the object to move, it must rise to where the
peaks can skip along the bottom surface. Thus a force is required just to set the object in motion. Some of the peaks will be broken off, also
requiring a force to maintain motion. Much of the friction is actually due to attractive forces between molecules making up the two objects,
so that even perfectly smooth surfaces are not friction-free. Such adhesive forces also depend on the substances the surfaces are made of,
explaining, for example, why rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles.

The magnitude of the frictional force has two forms: one for static situations (static friction), the other for when
there is motion (kinetic friction).

When there is no motion between the objects, the magnitude of static friction                       is
                                                                                                                                        5.1
where     is the coefficient of static friction and          is the magnitude of the normal force (the force perpendicular to
the surface).


  Magnitude of Static Friction
  Magnitude of static friction         is
                                                                                                                                      5.2
  where       is the coefficient of static friction and        is the magnitude of the normal force.


The symbol means less than or equal to, implying that static friction can have a minimum and a maximum value of
     . Static friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to whatever force is exerted, up to
its maximum limit. Once the applied force exceeds              , the object will move. Thus

                                                                                                                                        5.3

Once an object is moving, the magnitude of kinetic friction                  is given by
                                                                                                                                        5.4
where    is the coefficient of kinetic friction. A system in which                          is described as a system in which friction
behaves simply.


  Magnitude of Kinetic Friction
  The magnitude of kinetic friction           is given by
                                                                                                                                      5.5
  where       is the coefficient of kinetic friction.


As seen in Table 5.1, the coefficients of kinetic friction are less than their static counterparts. That values of in
Table 5.1 are stated to only one or, at most, two digits is an indication of the approximate description of friction
given by the above two equations.

                            TABLE 5.1 Coefficients of Static and Kinetic Friction

      The equations given earlier include the dependence of friction on materials and the normal force. The direction of
      friction is always opposite that of motion, parallel to the surface between objects, and perpendicular to the normal
      force. For example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the floor) has a mass of 100 kg, then the
      normal force would be equal to its weight,                                                 , perpendicular to the floor. If
      the coefficient of static friction is 0.45, you would have to exert a force parallel to the floor greater than
                                                     to move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and the coefficient
      of kinetic friction might be 0.30, so that a force of only 290 N (                                     ) would keep it
      moving at a constant speed. If the floor is lubricated, both coefficients are considerably less than they would be
      without lubrication. Coefficient of friction is a unit less quantity with a magnitude usually between 0 and 1.0. The
      coefficient of the friction depends on the two surfaces that are in contact.


        Take-Home Experiment
        Find a small plastic object (such as a food container) and slide it on a kitchen table by giving it a gentle tap. Now
        spray water on the table, simulating a light shower of rain. What happens now when you give the object the
        same-sized tap? Now add a few drops of (vegetable or olive) oil on the surface of the water and give the same
        tap. What happens now? This latter situation is particularly important for drivers to note, especially after a light
        rain shower. Why?


      Many people have experienced the slipperiness of walking on ice. However, many parts of the body, especially the
      joints, have much smaller coefficients of friction—often three or four times less than ice. A joint is formed by the
      ends of two bones, which are connected by thick tissues. The knee joint is formed by the lower leg bone (the tibia)

and the thighbone (the femur). The hip is a ball (at the end of the femur) and socket (part of the pelvis) joint. The
ends of the bones in the joint are covered by cartilage, which provides a smooth, almost glassy surface. The joints
also produce a fluid (synovial fluid) that reduces friction and wear. A damaged or arthritic joint can be replaced by an
artificial joint (Figure 5.3). These replacements can be made of metals (stainless steel or titanium) or plastic
(polyethylene), also with very small coefficients of friction.

X-rays of the right knee joint replacement. (credit: Mike Baird, Flickr)

Other natural lubricants include saliva produced in our mouths to aid in the swallowing process, and the slippery
mucus found between organs in the body, allowing them to move freely past each other during heartbeats, during
breathing, and when a person moves. Artificial lubricants are also common in hospitals and doctor’s clinics. For
example, when ultrasonic imaging is carried out, the gel that couples the transducer to the skin also serves to
lubricate the surface between the transducer and the skin—thereby reducing the coefficient of friction between the
two surfaces. This allows the transducer to move freely over the skin.


        EXAMPLE 5.1

Skiing Exercise
A skier with a mass of 62 kg is sliding down a snowy slope. Find the coefficient of kinetic friction for the skier if
friction is known to be 45.0 N.

Strategy

The magnitude of kinetic friction was given in to be 45.0 N. Kinetic friction is related to the normal force as
            ; thus, the coefficient of kinetic friction can be found if we can find the normal force of the skier on a
slope. The normal force is always perpendicular to the surface, and since there is no motion perpendicular to the
surface, the normal force should equal the component of the skier’s weight perpendicular to the slope. (See the
skier and free-body diagram in Figure 5.4.)
202   5 • Further Applications of Newton's Laws: Friction, Drag, and Elasticity




      FIGURE 5.4 The motion of the skier and friction are parallel to the slope and so it is most convenient to project all forces onto a coordinate
      system where one axis is parallel to the slope and the other is perpendicular (axes shown to left of skier). (the normal force) is
      perpendicular to the slope, and (the friction) is parallel to the slope, but (the skier’s weight) has components along both axes, namely
          and      . is equal in magnitude to      , so there is no motion perpendicular to the slope. However, is less than        in magnitude, so
      there is acceleration down the slope (along the x-axis).

      That is,
                                                                                                                                               5.6
      Substituting this into our expression for kinetic friction, we get
                                                                                                                                               5.7
      which can now be solved for the coefficient of kinetic friction               .

      Solution

      Solving for      gives

                                                                                                                                               5.8

      Substituting known values on the right-hand side of the equation,

                                                                                                                                               5.9

      Discussion

      This result is a little smaller than the coefficient listed in Table 5.1 for waxed wood on snow, but it is still reasonable
      since values of the coefficients of friction can vary greatly. In situations like this, where an object of mass slides
      down a slope that makes an angle with the horizontal, friction is given by                         . All objects will slide
      down a slope with constant acceleration under these circumstances. Proof of this is left for this chapter’s Problems
      and Exercises.



        Take-Home Experiment
        An object will slide down an inclined plane at a constant velocity if the net force on the object is zero. We can use
        this fact to measure the coefficient of kinetic friction between two objects. As shown in Example 5.1, the kinetic
        friction on a slope                   . The component of the weight down the slope is equal to              (see the
        free-body diagram in Figure 5.4). These forces act in opposite directions, so when they have equal magnitude,
        the acceleration is zero. Writing these out:
                                                                                                                                           5.10

  Put a coin on a book and tilt it until the coin slides at a constant velocity down the book. You might need to tap
  the book lightly to get the coin to move. Measure the angle of tilt relative to the horizontal and find . Note that
  the coin will not start to slide at all until an angle greater than is attained, since the coefficient of static friction
  is larger than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Discuss how this may affect the value for     and its uncertainty.


We have discussed that when an object rests on a horizontal surface, there is a normal force supporting it equal in
magnitude to its weight. Furthermore, simple friction is always proportional to the normal force.


  Making Connections: Submicroscopic Explanations of Friction
  The simpler aspects of friction dealt with so far are its macroscopic (large-scale) characteristics. Great strides
  have been made in the atomic-scale explanation of friction during the past several decades. Researchers are
  finding that the atomic nature of friction seems to have several fundamental characteristics. These
  characteristics not only explain some of the simpler aspects of friction—they also hold the potential for the
  development of nearly friction-free environments that could save hundreds of billions of dollars in energy which
  is currently being converted (unnecessarily) to heat.


Figure 5.5 illustrates one macroscopic characteristic of friction that is explained by microscopic (small-scale)
research. We have noted that friction is proportional to the normal force, but not to the area in contact, a somewhat
counterintuitive notion. When two rough surfaces are in contact, the actual contact area is a tiny fraction of the total
area since only high spots touch. When a greater normal force is exerted, the actual contact area increases, and it is
found that the friction is proportional to this area.




FIGURE 5.5 Two rough surfaces in contact have a much smaller area of actual contact than their total area. When there is a greater normal
force as a result of a greater applied force, the area of actual contact increases as does friction.

But the atomic-scale view promises to explain far more than the simpler features of friction. The mechanism for how
heat is generated is now being determined. In other words, why do surfaces get warmer when rubbed? Essentially,
atoms are linked with one another to form lattices. When surfaces rub, the surface atoms adhere and cause atomic
lattices to vibrate—essentially creating sound waves that penetrate the material. The sound waves diminish with
distance and their energy is converted into heat. Chemical reactions that are related to frictional wear can also occur
between atoms and molecules on the surfaces. Figure 5.6 shows how the tip of a probe drawn across another
material is deformed by atomic-scale friction. The force needed to drag the tip can be measured and is found to be
related to shear stress, which will be discussed later in this chapter. The variation in shear stress is remarkable
(more than a factor of       ) and difficult to predict theoretically, but shear stress is yielding a fundamental
understanding of a large-scale phenomenon known since ancient times—friction.

      5.2 Drag Forces
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Express mathematically the drag force.
       • Discuss the applications of drag force.
       • Define terminal velocity.
       • Determine the terminal velocity given mass.

      Another interesting force in everyday life is the force of drag on an object when it is moving in a fluid (either a gas or
      a liquid). You feel the drag force when you move your hand through water. You might also feel it if you move your
      hand during a strong wind. The faster you move your hand, the harder it is to move. You feel a smaller drag force
      when you tilt your hand so only the side goes through the air—you have decreased the area of your hand that faces
      the direction of motion. Like friction, the drag force always opposes the motion of an object. Unlike simple friction,
      the drag force is proportional to some function of the velocity of the object in that fluid. This functionality is
      complicated and depends upon the shape of the object, its size, its velocity, and the fluid it is in. For most large
      objects such as bicyclists, cars, and baseballs not moving too slowly, the magnitude of the drag force          is found to
      be proportional to the square of the speed of the object. We can write this relationship mathematically as                 .
      When taking into account other factors, this relationship becomes

                                                                                                                                        5.13

      where is the drag coefficient, is the area of the object facing the fluid, and is the density of the fluid. (Recall
      that density is mass per unit volume.) This equation can also be written in a more generalized fashion as           ,
      where is a constant equivalent to             . We have set the exponent for these equations as 2 because, when an
      object is moving at high velocity through air, the magnitude of the drag force is proportional to the square of the

speed. As we shall see in a few pages on fluid dynamics, for small particles moving at low speeds in a fluid, the
exponent is equal to 1.


  Drag Force
  Drag force       is found to be proportional to the square of the speed of the object. Mathematically

                                                                                                                               5.14

                                                                                                                               5.15

  where      is the drag coefficient,     is the area of the object facing the fluid, and       is the density of the fluid.


Athletes as well as car designers seek to reduce the drag force to lower their race times. (See Figure 5.7).
“Aerodynamic” shaping of an automobile can reduce the drag force and so increase a car’s gas mileage.




FIGURE 5.7 From racing cars to bobsled racers, aerodynamic shaping is crucial to achieving top speeds. Bobsleds are designed for speed.
They are shaped like a bullet with tapered fins. (credit: U.S. Army, via Wikimedia Commons)

The value of the drag coefficient,       , is determined empirically, usually with the use of a wind tunnel. (See Figure
5.8).




                         FIGURE 5.8 NASA researchers test a model plane in a wind tunnel. (credit: NASA/Ames)

The drag coefficient can depend upon velocity, but we will assume that it is a constant here. Table 5.2 lists some
typical drag coefficients for a variety of objects. Notice that the drag coefficient is a dimensionless quantity. At
highway speeds, over 50% of the power of a car is used to overcome air drag. The most fuel-efficient cruising speed
is about 70–80 km/h (about 45–50 mi/h). For this reason, during the 1970s oil crisis in the United States, maximum
speeds on highways were set at about 90 km/h (55 mi/h).

      the 400 m race. Many swimmers in the 2008 Beijing Olympics wore (Speedo) body suits; it might have made a
      difference in breaking many world records (See Figure 5.9). Most elite swimmers (and cyclists) shave their body hair.
      Such innovations can have the effect of slicing away milliseconds in a race, sometimes making the difference
      between a gold and a silver medal. One consequence is that careful and precise guidelines must be continuously
      developed to maintain the integrity of the sport.

Some interesting situations connected to Newton’s second law occur when considering the effects of drag forces
upon a moving object. For instance, consider a skydiver falling through air under the influence of gravity. The two
forces acting on him are the force of gravity and the drag force (ignoring the buoyant force). The downward force of
gravity remains constant regardless of the velocity at which the person is moving. However, as the person’s velocity
increases, the magnitude of the drag force increases until the magnitude of the drag force is equal to the
gravitational force, thus producing a net force of zero. A zero net force means that there is no acceleration, as given
by Newton’s second law. At this point, the person’s velocity remains constant and we say that the person has
reached his terminal velocity ( ). Since      is proportional to the speed, a heavier skydiver must go faster for     to
equal his weight. Let’s see how this works out more quantitatively.

At the terminal velocity,
                                                                                                                   5.16
Thus,
                                                                                                                   5.17
Using the equation for drag force, we have

                                                                                                                   5.18

Solving for the velocity, we obtain

                                                                                                                   5.19

Assume the density of air is                . A 75-kg skydiver descending head first will have an area
approximately                and a drag coefficient of approximately         . We find that



                                                                                                                   5.20



This means a skydiver with a mass of 75 kg achieves a maximum terminal velocity of about 350 km/h while traveling
in a headfirst position, minimizing the area and his drag. In a spread-eagle position, that terminal velocity may
decrease to about 200 km/h as the area increases. This terminal velocity becomes much smaller after the parachute
opens.


  Take-Home Experiment
  This interesting activity examines the effect of weight upon terminal velocity. Gather together some nested
  coffee filters. Leaving them in their original shape, measure the time it takes for one, two, three, four, and five
  nested filters to fall to the floor from the same height (roughly 2 m). (Note that, due to the way the filters are
  nested, drag is constant and only mass varies.) They obtain terminal velocity quite quickly, so find this velocity
  as a function of mass. Plot the terminal velocity versus mass. Also plot        versus mass. Which of these
  relationships is more linear? What can you conclude from these graphs?

      weight). Using the equation of drag force, we find                          .

      Thus the terminal velocity        can be written as

                                                                                                                           5.21

      Solution

      All quantities are known except the person’s projected area. This is an adult (85 kg) falling spread eagle. We can
      estimate the frontal area as

                                                                                                                           5.22

      Using our equation for      , we find that


                                                                                                                           5.23


      Discussion

      This result is consistent with the value for mentioned earlier. The 75-kg skydiver going feet first had a                     .
      He weighed less but had a smaller frontal area and so a smaller drag due to the air.


      The size of the object that is falling through air presents another interesting application of air drag. If you fall from a
      5-m high branch of a tree, you will likely get hurt—possibly fracturing a bone. However, a small squirrel does this all
      the time, without getting hurt. You don’t reach a terminal velocity in such a short distance, but the squirrel does.

      The following interesting quote on animal size and terminal velocity is from a 1928 essay by a British biologist, J.B.S.
      Haldane, titled “On Being the Right Size.”

      To the mouse and any smaller animal, [gravity] presents practically no dangers. You can drop a mouse down a
      thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the
      ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, and a horse splashes. For the resistance presented to movement
      by the air is proportional to the surface of the moving object. Divide an animal’s length, breadth, and height each by
      ten; its weight is reduced to a thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the resistance to falling in the case
      of the small animal is relatively ten times greater than the driving force.

      The above quadratic dependence of air drag upon velocity does not hold if the object is very small, is going very
      slow, or is in a denser medium than air. Then we find that the drag force is proportional just to the velocity. This
      relationship is given by Stokes’ law, which states that
                                                                                                                           5.24
      where is the radius of the object,       is the viscosity of the fluid, and       is the object’s velocity.


        Stokes’ Law
                                                                                                                         5.25
        where is the radius of the object,         is the viscosity of the fluid, and     is the object’s velocity.


      Good examples of this law are provided by microorganisms, pollen, and dust particles. Because each of these
      objects is so small, we find that many of these objects travel unaided only at a constant (terminal) velocity. Terminal
      velocities for bacteria (size about        ) can be about           . To move at a greater speed, many bacteria swim using
      flagella (organelles shaped like little tails) that are powered by little motors embedded in the cell. Sediment in a lake
      can move at a greater terminal velocity (about            ), so it can take days to reach the bottom of the lake after
      being deposited on the surface.

If we compare animals living on land with those in water, you can see how drag has influenced evolution. Fishes,
dolphins, and even massive whales are streamlined in shape to reduce drag forces. Birds are streamlined and
migratory species that fly large distances often have particular features such as long necks. Flocks of birds fly in the
shape of a spear head as the flock forms a streamlined pattern (see Figure 5.10). In humans, one important
example of streamlining is the shape of sperm, which need to be efficient in their use of energy.

birds, and also allows them a better way to communicate. (credit: Julo, Wikimedia Commons)


  Galileo’s Experiment
  Galileo is said to have dropped two objects of different masses from the Tower of Pisa. He measured how long it
  took each to reach the ground. Since stopwatches weren’t readily available, how do you think he measured their
  fall time? If the objects were the same size, but with different masses, what do you think he should have
  observed? Would this result be different if done on the Moon?


5.3 Elasticity: Stress and Strain
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • State Hooke’s law.
 • Explain Hooke’s law using graphical representation between deformation and applied force.
 • Discuss the three types of deformations such as changes in length, sideways shear and changes in
    volume.
 • Describe with examples the young’s modulus, shear modulus and bulk modulus.
 • Determine the change in length given mass, length and radius.

We now move from consideration of forces that affect the motion of an object (such as friction and drag) to those
that affect an object’s shape. If a bulldozer pushes a car into a wall, the car will not move but it will noticeably
change shape. A change in shape due to the application of a force is a deformation. Even very small forces are
known to cause some deformation. For small deformations, two important characteristics are observed. First, the
object returns to its original shape when the force is removed—that is, the deformation is elastic for small
deformations. Second, the size of the deformation is proportional to the force—that is, for small deformations,
Hooke’s law is obeyed. In equation form, Hooke’s law is given by
                                                                                                                                   5.26
where      is the amount of deformation (the change in length, for example) produced by the force , and is a
proportionality constant that depends on the shape and composition of the object and the direction of the force.
Note that this force is a function of the deformation   —it is not constant as a kinetic friction force is. Rearranging
this to

                                                                                                                                   5.27
210   5 • Further Applications of Newton's Laws: Friction, Drag, and Elasticity



      makes it clear that the deformation is proportional to the applied force. Figure 5.11 shows the Hooke’s law
      relationship between the extension       of a spring or of a human bone. For metals or springs, the straight line region
      in which Hooke’s law pertains is much larger. Bones are brittle and the elastic region is small and the fracture
      abrupt. Eventually a large enough stress to the material will cause it to break or fracture. Tensile strength is the
      breaking stress that will cause permanent deformation or fracture of a material.


        Hooke’s Law
                                                                                                                                           5.28
        where     is the amount of deformation (the change in length, for example) produced by the force , and is a
        proportionality constant that depends on the shape and composition of the object and the direction of the force.

                                                                                                                                           5.29




      FIGURE 5.11 A graph of deformation         versus applied force . The straight segment is the linear region where Hooke’s law is obeyed.
      The slope of the straight region is . For larger forces, the graph is curved but the deformation is still elastic— will return to zero if the
      force is removed. Still greater forces permanently deform the object until it finally fractures. The shape of the curve near fracture depends
      on several factors, including how the force is applied. Note that in this graph the slope increases just before fracture, indicating that a
      small increase in is producing a large increase in near the fracture.

      The proportionality constant depends upon a number of factors for the material. For example, a guitar string made
      of nylon stretches when it is tightened, and the elongation       is proportional to the force applied (at least for small
      deformations). Thicker nylon strings and ones made of steel stretch less for the same applied force, implying they
      have a larger (see Figure 5.12). Finally, all three strings return to their normal lengths when the force is removed,
      provided the deformation is small. Most materials will behave in this manner if the deformation is less than about
      0.1% or about 1 part in      .




      FIGURE 5.12 The same force, in this case a weight ( ), applied to three different guitar strings of identical length produces the three
      different deformations shown as shaded segments. The string on the left is thin nylon, the one in the middle is thicker nylon, and the one on

  Stretch Yourself a Little
  How would you go about measuring the proportionality constant of a rubber band? If a rubber band stretched
  3 cm when a 100-g mass was attached to it, then how much would it stretch if two similar rubber bands were
  attached to the same mass—even if put together in parallel or alternatively if tied together in series?


We now consider three specific types of deformations: changes in length (tension and compression), sideways shear
(stress), and changes in volume. All deformations are assumed to be small unless otherwise stated.

Changes in Length—Tension and Compression: Elastic Modulus
A change in length      is produced when a force is applied to a wire or rod parallel to its length                  , either stretching
it (a tension) or compressing it. (See Figure 5.13.)




FIGURE 5.13 (a) Tension. The rod is stretched a length   when a force is applied parallel to its length. (b) Compression. The same rod is
compressed by forces with the same magnitude in the opposite direction. For very small deformations and uniform materials,       is
approximately the same for the same magnitude of tension or compression. For larger deformations, the cross-sectional area changes as
the rod is compressed or stretched.

Experiments have shown that the change in length (        ) depends on only a few variables. As already noted,         is
proportional to the force and depends on the substance from which the object is made. Additionally, the change in
length is proportional to the original length     and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the wire or
rod. For example, a long guitar string will stretch more than a short one, and a thick string will stretch less than a
thin one. We can combine all these factors into one equation for       :

                                                                                                                                   5.30

where       is the change in length, the applied force, is a factor, called the elastic modulus or Young’s modulus,
that depends on the substance, is the cross-sectional area, and       is the original length. Table 5.3 lists values of
   for several materials—those with a large are said to have a large tensile stiffness because they deform less for a
given tension or compression.

TABLE 5.3 Elastic Moduli

Young’s moduli are not listed for liquids and gases in Table 5.3 because they cannot be stretched or compressed in
only one direction. Note that there is an assumption that the object does not accelerate, so that there are actually
two applied forces of magnitude acting in opposite directions. For example, the strings in Figure 5.13 are being
pulled down by a force of magnitude and held up by the ceiling, which also exerts a force of magnitude .


       EXAMPLE 5.3

The Stretch of a Long Cable
Suspension cables are used to carry gondolas at ski resorts. (See Figure 5.14) Consider a suspension cable that
includes an unsupported span of 3020 m. Calculate the amount of stretch in the steel cable. Assume that the cable
has a diameter of 5.6 cm and the maximum tension it can withstand is               .




      FIGURE 5.14 Gondolas travel along suspension cables at the Gala Yuzawa ski resort in Japan. (credit: Rudy Herman, Flickr)

Strategy

The force is equal to the maximum tension, or                         . The cross-sectional area is
                         . The equation                      can be used to find the change in length.

Solution

All quantities are known. Thus,


                                                                                                                                  5.31


Discussion

This is quite a stretch, but only about 0.6% of the unsupported length. Effects of temperature upon length might be
important in these environments.


Bones, on the whole, do not fracture due to tension or compression. Rather they generally fracture due to sideways
impact or bending, resulting in the bone shearing or snapping. The behavior of bones under tension and
compression is important because it determines the load the bones can carry. Bones are classified as weight-
bearing structures such as columns in buildings and trees. Weight-bearing structures have special features; columns
in building have steel-reinforcing rods while trees and bones are fibrous. The bones in different parts of the body
serve different structural functions and are prone to different stresses. Thus the bone in the top of the femur is
214   5 • Further Applications of Newton's Laws: Friction, Drag, and Elasticity



      arranged in thin sheets separated by marrow while in other places the bones can be cylindrical and filled with
      marrow or just solid. Overweight people have a tendency toward bone damage due to sustained compressions in
      bone joints and tendons.

      Another biological example of Hooke’s law occurs in tendons. Functionally, the tendon (the tissue connecting
      muscle to bone) must stretch easily at first when a force is applied, but offer a much greater restoring force for a
      greater strain. Figure 5.15 shows a stress-strain relationship for a human tendon. Some tendons have a high
      collagen content so there is relatively little strain, or length change; others, like support tendons (as in the leg) can
      change length up to 10%. Note that this stress-strain curve is nonlinear, since the slope of the line changes in
      different regions. In the first part of the stretch called the toe region, the fibers in the tendon begin to align in the
      direction of the stress—this is called uncrimping. In the linear region, the fibrils will be stretched, and in the failure
      region individual fibers begin to break. A simple model of this relationship can be illustrated by springs in parallel:
      different springs are activated at different lengths of stretch. Examples of this are given in the problems at end of
      this chapter. Ligaments (tissue connecting bone to bone) behave in a similar way.




      FIGURE 5.15 Typical stress-strain curve for mammalian tendon. Three regions are shown: (1) toe region (2) linear region, and (3) failure
      region.

      Unlike bones and tendons, which need to be strong as well as elastic, the arteries and lungs need to be very
      stretchable. The elastic properties of the arteries are essential for blood flow. The pressure in the arteries increases
      and arterial walls stretch when the blood is pumped out of the heart. When the aortic valve shuts, the pressure in
      the arteries drops and the arterial walls relax to maintain the blood flow. When you feel your pulse, you are feeling
      exactly this—the elastic behavior of the arteries as the blood gushes through with each pump of the heart. If the
      arteries were rigid, you would not feel a pulse. The heart is also an organ with special elastic properties. The lungs
      expand with muscular effort when we breathe in but relax freely and elastically when we breathe out. Our skins are
      particularly elastic, especially for the young. A young person can go from 100 kg to 60 kg with no visible sag in their
      skins. The elasticity of all organs reduces with age. Gradual physiological aging through reduction in elasticity starts
      in the early 20s.

Solution

All quantities except         are known. Note that the compression value for Young’s modulus for bone must be used
here. Thus,


                                                                                                                           5.33


Discussion

This small change in length seems reasonable, consistent with our experience that bones are rigid. In fact, even the
rather large forces encountered during strenuous physical activity do not compress or bend bones by large amounts.
Although bone is rigid compared with fat or muscle, several of the substances listed in Table 5.3 have larger values
of Young’s modulus . In other words, they are more rigid.


The equation for change in length is traditionally rearranged and written in the following form:

                                                                                                                           5.34

The ratio of force to area,     , is defined as stress (measured in          ), and the ratio of the change in length to
length,      , is defined as strain (a unitless quantity). In other words,

                                                                                                                           5.35
In this form, the equation is analogous to Hooke’s law, with stress analogous to force and strain analogous to
deformation. If we again rearrange this equation to the form

we see that it is the same as Hooke’s law with a proportionality constant

                                                                                                                           5.37

This general idea—that force and the deformation it causes are proportional for small deformations—applies to
changes in length, sideways bending, and changes in volume.


  Stress
  The ratio of force to area,     , is defined as stress measured in N/m2.



  Strain
  The ratio of the change in length to length,      , is defined as strain (a unitless quantity). In other words,

                                                                                                                         5.38


Sideways Stress: Shear Modulus
Figure 5.16 illustrates what is meant by a sideways stress or a shearing force. Here the deformation is called  and
it is perpendicular to   , rather than parallel as with tension and compression. Shear deformation behaves similarly
to tension and compression and can be described with similar equations. The expression for shear deformation is

                                                                                                                           5.39

      where is the shear modulus (see Table 5.3) and is the force applied perpendicular to            and parallel to the
      cross-sectional area . Again, to keep the object from accelerating, there are actually two equal and opposite forces
         applied across opposite faces, as illustrated in Figure 5.16. The equation is logical—for example, it is easier to
      bend a long thin pencil (small ) than a short thick one, and both are more easily bent than similar steel rods (large
        ).


        Shear Deformation

                                                                                                                                            5.40

        where is the shear modulus and                is the force applied perpendicular to             and parallel to the cross-sectional
        area .




      FIGURE 5.16 Shearing forces are applied perpendicular to the length         and parallel to the area , producing a deformation      . Vertical
      forces are not shown, but it should be kept in mind that in addition to the two shearing forces, , there must be supporting forces to keep
      the object from rotating. The distorting effects of these supporting forces are ignored in this treatment. The weight of the object also is not
      shown, since it is usually negligible compared with forces large enough to cause significant deformations.

      Examination of the shear moduli in Table 5.3 reveals some telling patterns. For example, shear moduli are less than
      Young’s moduli for most materials. Bone is a remarkable exception. Its shear modulus is not only greater than its
      Young’s modulus, but it is as large as that of steel. This is why bones are so rigid.

      The spinal column (consisting of 26 vertebral segments separated by discs) provides the main support for the head
      and upper part of the body. The spinal column has normal curvature for stability, but this curvature can be
      increased, leading to increased shearing forces on the lower vertebrae. Discs are better at withstanding
      compressional forces than shear forces. Because the spine is not vertical, the weight of the upper body exerts some
      of both. Pregnant women and people that are overweight (with large abdomens) need to move their shoulders back
      to maintain balance, thereby increasing the curvature in their spine and so increasing the shear component of the
      stress. An increased angle due to more curvature increases the shear forces along the plane. These higher shear
      forces increase the risk of back injury through ruptured discs. The lumbosacral disc (the wedge shaped disc below
      the last vertebrae) is particularly at risk because of its location.

      The shear moduli for concrete and brick are very small; they are too highly variable to be listed. Concrete used in
      buildings can withstand compression, as in pillars and arches, but is very poor against shear, as might be
      encountered in heavily loaded floors or during earthquakes. Modern structures were made possible by the use of
      steel and steel-reinforced concrete. Almost by definition, liquids and gases have shear moduli near zero, because
      they flow in response to shearing forces.

FIGURE 5.17 Side view of a nail with a picture hung from it. The nail flexes very slightly (shown much larger than actual) because of the
shearing effect of the supported weight. Also shown is the upward force of the wall on the nail, illustrating that there are equal and opposite
forces applied across opposite cross sections of the nail. See Example 5.5 for a calculation of the mass of the picture.

Strategy

The force on the nail (neglecting the nail’s own weight) is the weight of the picture                     . If we can find     , then the
mass of the picture is just . The equation                 can be solved for .

Solution

Solving the equation                        for   , we see that all other quantities can be found:

                                                                                                                                       5.41

S is found in Table 5.3 and is                               . The radius is 0.750 mm (as seen in the figure), so the cross-
sectional area is

                                                                                                                                       5.42

The value for        is also shown in the figure. Thus,

                                                                                                                                       5.43

This 51 N force is the weight         of the picture, so the picture’s mass is

                                                                                                                                       5.44

Discussion

This is a fairly massive picture, and it is impressive that the nail flexes only                      —an amount undetectable to the
unaided eye.


Changes in Volume: Bulk Modulus
An object will be compressed in all directions if inward forces are applied evenly on all its surfaces as in Figure 5.18.
It is relatively easy to compress gases and extremely difficult to compress liquids and solids. For example, air in a
wine bottle is compressed when it is corked. But if you try corking a brim-full bottle, you cannot compress the
wine—some must be removed if the cork is to be inserted. The reason for these different compressibilities is that
atoms and molecules are separated by large empty spaces in gases but packed close together in liquids and solids.
To compress a gas, you must force its atoms and molecules closer together. To compress liquids and solids, you
must actually compress their atoms and molecules, and very strong electromagnetic forces in them oppose this
compression.
218   5 • Further Applications of Newton's Laws: Friction, Drag, and Elasticity




      FIGURE 5.18 An inward force on all surfaces compresses this cube. Its change in volume is proportional to the force per unit area and its
      original volume, and is related to the compressibility of the substance.

      We can describe the compression or volume deformation of an object with an equation. First, we note that a force
      “applied evenly” is defined to have the same stress, or ratio of force to area on all surfaces. The deformation
      produced is a change in volume       , which is found to behave very similarly to the shear, tension, and compression
      previously discussed. (This is not surprising, since a compression of the entire object is equivalent to compressing
      each of its three dimensions.) The relationship of the change in volume to other physical quantities is given by

                                                                                                                                          5.45

      where      is the bulk modulus (see Table 5.3),           is the original volume, and         is the force per unit area applied
      uniformly inward on all surfaces. Note that no bulk moduli are given for gases.

      What are some examples of bulk compression of solids and liquids? One practical example is the manufacture of
      industrial-grade diamonds by compressing carbon with an extremely large force per unit area. The carbon atoms
      rearrange their crystalline structure into the more tightly packed pattern of diamonds. In nature, a similar process
      occurs deep underground, where extremely large forces result from the weight of overlying material. Another
      natural source of large compressive forces is the pressure created by the weight of water, especially in deep parts of
      the oceans. Water exerts an inward force on all surfaces of a submerged object, and even on the water itself. At
      great depths, water is measurably compressed, as the following example illustrates.


              EXAMPLE 5.6

      Ocean Depths?
      Calculate the fractional decrease in volume (             ) for seawater at 5.00 km depth, where the force per unit area is
                            .

      Strategy

      Equation                     is the correct physical relationship. All quantities in the equation except                 are known.

      Solution

      Solving for the unknown            gives


                                                                                                                                          5.46

Discussion

Although measurable, this is not a significant decrease in volume considering that the force per unit area is about
500 atmospheres (1 million pounds per square foot). Liquids and solids are extraordinarily difficult to compress.


Conversely, very large forces are created by liquids and solids when they try to expand but are constrained from
doing so—which is equivalent to compressing them to less than their normal volume. This often occurs when a
contained material warms up, since most materials expand when their temperature increases. If the materials are
tightly constrained, they deform or break their container. Another very common example occurs when water freezes.
Water, unlike most materials, expands when it freezes, and it can easily fracture a boulder, rupture a biological cell,
or crack an engine block that gets in its way.

Other types of deformations, such as torsion or twisting, behave analogously to the tension, shear, and bulk
deformations considered here.

INTRODUCTION TO UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION AND GRAVITATION Many motions, such as the arc of a bird’s
flight or Earth’s path around the Sun, are curved. Recall that Newton’s first law tells us that motion is along a straight
line at constant speed unless there is a net external force. We will therefore study not only motion along curves, but
also the forces that cause it, including gravitational forces. In some ways, this chapter is a continuation of Dynamics:
Newton's Laws of Motion as we study more applications of Newton’s laws of motion.

This chapter deals with the simplest form of curved motion, uniform circular motion, motion in a circular path at
constant speed. Studying this topic illustrates most concepts associated with rotational motion and leads to the
study of many new topics we group under the name rotation. Pure rotational motion occurs when points in an object
move in circular paths centered on one point. Pure translational motion is motion with no rotation. Some motion
combines both types, such as a rotating hockey puck moving along ice.
228   6 • Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation




      6.1 Rotation Angle and Angular Velocity
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define arc length, rotation angle, radius of curvature and angular velocity.
       • Calculate the angular velocity of a car wheel spin.

      In Kinematics, we studied motion along a straight line and introduced such concepts as displacement, velocity, and
      acceleration. Two-Dimensional Kinematics dealt with motion in two dimensions. Projectile motion is a special case
      of two-dimensional kinematics in which the object is projected into the air, while being subject to the gravitational
      force, and lands a distance away. In this chapter, we consider situations where the object does not land but moves
      in a curve. We begin the study of uniform circular motion by defining two angular quantities needed to describe
      rotational motion.

      Rotation Angle
      When objects rotate about some axis—for example, when the CD (compact disc) in Figure 6.2 rotates about its
      center—each point in the object follows a circular arc. Consider a line from the center of the CD to its edge. Each pit
      used to record sound along this line moves through the same angle in the same amount of time. The rotation angle
      is the amount of rotation and is analogous to linear distance. We define the rotation angle      to be the ratio of the
      arc length to the radius of curvature:

                                                                                                                                                 6.1

The arc length     is the distance traveled along a circular path as shown in Figure 6.3 Note that is the radius of
curvature of the circular path.

We know that for one complete revolution, the arc length is the circumference of a circle of radius . The
circumference of a circle is . Thus for one complete revolution the rotation angle is

                                                                                                                                     6.2

This result is the basis for defining the units used to measure rotation angles,               to be radians (rad), defined so that
                                                                                                                                     6.3
A comparison of some useful angles expressed in both degrees and radians is shown in Table 6.1.

      Angular Velocity
      How fast is an object rotating? We define angular velocity                as the rate of change of an angle. In symbols, this is

                                                                                                                                              6.6

      where an angular rotation      takes place in a time . The greater the rotation angle in a given amount of time, the
      greater the angular velocity. The units for angular velocity are radians per second (rad/s).

      Angular velocity is analogous to linear velocity . To get the precise relationship between angular and linear
      velocity, we again consider a pit on the rotating CD. This pit moves an arc length  in a time , and so it has a
      linear velocity

                                                                                                                                              6.7

      From               we see that                 . Substituting this into the expression for         gives

                                                                                                                                              6.8

      We write this relationship in two different ways and gain two different insights:

                                                                                                                                              6.9

      The first relationship in                          states that the linear velocity       is proportional to the distance from the
      center of rotation, thus, it is largest for a point on the rim (largest ), as you might expect. We can also call this linear
      speed of a point on the rim the tangential speed. The second relationship in                          can be illustrated
      by considering the tire of a moving car. Note that the speed of a point on the rim of the tire is the same as the speed
        of the car. See Figure 6.5. So the faster the car moves, the faster the tire spins—large means a large , because
              . Similarly, a larger-radius tire rotating at the same angular velocity ( ) will produce a greater linear speed ( )
      for the car.




      FIGURE 6.5 A car moving at a velocity to the right has a tire rotating with an angular velocity .The speed of the tread of the tire relative
      to the axle is , the same as if the car were jacked up. Thus the car moves forward at linear velocity     , where is the tire radius. A
      larger angular velocity for the tire means a greater velocity for the car.

Strategy

Because the linear speed of the tire rim is the same as the speed of the car, we have                                    The radius of the
tire is given to be            Knowing and , we can use the second relationship in                                           to calculate
the angular velocity.

Solution

To calculate the angular velocity, we will use the following relationship:

                                                                                                                                       6.10

Substituting the knowns,

                                                                                                                                       6.11

Discussion

When we cancel units in the above calculation, we get 50.0/s. But the angular velocity must have units of rad/s.
Because radians are actually unitless (radians are defined as a ratio of distance), we can simply insert them into the
answer for the angular velocity. Also note that if an earth mover with much larger tires, say 1.20 m in radius, were
moving at the same speed of 15.0 m/s, its tires would rotate more slowly. They would have an angular velocity
                                                                                                                                       6.12


Both and have directions (hence they are angular and linear velocities, respectively). Angular velocity has only
two directions with respect to the axis of rotation—it is either clockwise or counterclockwise. Linear velocity is
tangent to the path, as illustrated in Figure 6.6.


  Take-Home Experiment
  Tie an object to the end of a string and swing it around in a horizontal circle above your head (swing at your
  wrist). Maintain uniform speed as the object swings and measure the angular velocity of the motion. What is the
  approximate speed of the object? Identify a point close to your hand and take appropriate measurements to
  calculate the linear speed at this point. Identify other circular motions and measure their angular velocities.




FIGURE 6.6 As an object moves in a circle, here a fly on the edge of an old-fashioned vinyl record, its instantaneous velocity is always
tangent to the circle. The direction of the angular velocity is clockwise in this case.

      6.2 Centripetal Acceleration
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Establish the expression for centripetal acceleration.
       • Explain the centrifuge.

      We know from kinematics that acceleration is a change in velocity, either in its magnitude or in its direction, or both.
      In uniform circular motion, the direction of the velocity changes constantly, so there is always an associated
      acceleration, even though the magnitude of the velocity might be constant. You experience this acceleration
      yourself when you turn a corner in your car. (If you hold the wheel steady during a turn and move at constant speed,
      you are in uniform circular motion.) What you notice is a sideways acceleration because you and the car are
      changing direction. The sharper the curve and the greater your speed, the more noticeable this acceleration will
      become. In this section we examine the direction and magnitude of that acceleration.

      Figure 6.7 shows an object moving in a circular path at constant speed. The direction of the instantaneous velocity is
      shown at two points along the path. Acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity, which points directly
      toward the center of rotation (the center of the circular path). This pointing is shown with the vector diagram in the
      figure. We call the acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion (resulting from a net external force)
      the centripetal acceleration( ); centripetal means “toward the center” or “center seeking.”




      FIGURE 6.7 The directions of the velocity of an object at two different points are shown, and the change in velocity          is seen to point
      directly toward the center of curvature. (See small inset.) Because               , the acceleration is also toward the center;      is called
      centripetal acceleration. (Because     is very small, the arc length    is equal to the chord length       for small time differences.)

      The direction of centripetal acceleration is toward the center of curvature, but what is its magnitude? Note that the
      triangle formed by the velocity vectors and the one formed by the radii and       are similar. Both the triangles ABC
      and PQR are isosceles triangles (two equal sides). The two equal sides of the velocity vector triangle are the speeds
                   . Using the properties of two similar triangles, we obtain

                                                                                                                                                  6.13

      Acceleration is            , and so we first solve this expression for              :

                                                                                                6.2 • Centripetal Acceleration   233




                                                                                                                      6.14

Then we divide this by    , yielding

                                                                                                                      6.15

Finally, noting that             and that            , the linear or tangential speed, we see that the magnitude of the
centripetal acceleration is

                                                                                                                      6.16

which is the acceleration of an object in a circle of radius at a speed . So, centripetal acceleration is greater at
high speeds and in sharp curves (smaller radius), as you have noticed when driving a car. But it is a bit surprising
that    is proportional to speed squared, implying, for example, that it is four times as hard to take a curve at 100
km/h than at 50 km/h. A sharp corner has a small radius, so that      is greater for tighter turns, as you have probably
noticed.

It is also useful to express    in terms of angular velocity. Substituting      into the above expression, we find
                       . We can express the magnitude of centripetal acceleration using either of two equations:

                                                                                                                      6.17

Recall that the direction of   is toward the center. You may use whichever expression is more convenient, as
illustrated in examples below.

A centrifuge (see Figure 6.8b) is a rotating device used to separate specimens of different densities. High
centripetal acceleration significantly decreases the time it takes for separation to occur, and makes separation
possible with small samples. Centrifuges are used in a variety of applications in science and medicine, including the
separation of single cell suspensions such as bacteria, viruses, and blood cells from a liquid medium and the
separation of macromolecules, such as DNA and protein, from a solution. Centrifuges are often rated in terms of
their centripetal acceleration relative to acceleration due to gravity   ; maximum centripetal acceleration of several
hundred thousand is possible in a vacuum. Human centrifuges, extremely large centrifuges, have been used to test
the tolerance of astronauts to the effects of accelerations larger than that of Earth’s gravity.


       EXAMPLE 6.2

How Does the Centripetal Acceleration of a Car Around a Curve Compare with That Due to
Gravity?
What is the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration of a car following a curve of radius 500 m at a speed of 25.0
m/s (about 90 km/h)? Compare the acceleration with that due to gravity for this fairly gentle curve taken at highway
speed. See Figure 6.8(a).

Strategy

Because    and are given, the first expression in                       is the most convenient to use.

Solution

Entering the given values of                and            into the first expression for    gives

                                                                                                                      6.18

Discussion

To compare this with the acceleration due to gravity                   , we take the ratio of
234   6 • Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation



                                                         . Thus,                    and is noticeable especially if you were not wearing a
      seat belt.




      FIGURE 6.8 (a) The car following a circular path at constant speed is accelerated perpendicular to its velocity, as shown. The magnitude of
      this centripetal acceleration is found in Example 6.2. (b) A particle of mass in a centrifuge is rotating at constant angular velocity . It must
      be accelerated perpendicular to its velocity or it would continue in a straight line. The magnitude of the necessary acceleration is found in
      Example 6.3.

                          Determine the ratio of this acceleration to that due to gravity. See Figure 6.8(b).

      Strategy

      The term rev/min stands for revolutions per minute. By converting this to radians per second, we obtain the angular
      velocity     . Because is given, we can use the second expression in the equation                                              to calculate
      the centripetal acceleration.

      Solution

      To convert                             to radians per second, we use the facts that one revolution is                       and one minute
      is 60.0 s. Thus,

                                                                                                                    6.19


Now the centripetal acceleration is given by the second expression in                         as

                                                                                                                    6.20

Converting 7.50 cm to meters and substituting known values gives

                                                                                                                    6.21

Note that the unitless radians are discarded in order to get the correct units for centripetal acceleration. Taking the
ratio of   to yields

                                                                                                                    6.22

Discussion

This last result means that the centripetal acceleration is 472,000 times as strong as . It is no wonder that such
high centrifuges are called ultracentrifuges. The extremely large accelerations involved greatly decrease the time
needed to cause the sedimentation of blood cells or other materials.


Of course, a net external force is needed to cause any acceleration, just as Newton proposed in his second law of
motion. So a net external force is needed to cause a centripetal acceleration. In Centripetal Force, we will consider
the forces involved in circular motion.

6.3 Centripetal Force
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Calculate coefficient of friction on a car tire.
 • Calculate ideal speed and angle of a car on a turn.

Any force or combination of forces can cause a centripetal or radial acceleration. Just a few examples are the
tension in the rope on a tether ball, the force of Earth’s gravity on the Moon, friction between roller skates and a rink
floor, a banked roadway’s force on a car, and forces on the tube of a spinning centrifuge.

Any net force causing uniform circular motion is called a centripetal force. The direction of a centripetal force is
toward the center of curvature, the same as the direction of centripetal acceleration. According to Newton’s second
law of motion, net force is mass times acceleration: net         . For uniform circular motion, the acceleration is the
centripetal acceleration—         . Thus, the magnitude of centripetal force    is
                                                                                                                    6.23

By using the expressions for centripetal acceleration     from                       , we get two expressions for the
centripetal force    in terms of mass, velocity, angular velocity, and radius of curvature:
236   6 • Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation




                                                                                                                                               6.24

      You may use whichever expression for centripetal force is more convenient. Centripetal force    is always
      perpendicular to the path and pointing to the center of curvature, because  is perpendicular to the velocity and
      pointing to the center of curvature.

      Note that if you solve the first expression for , you get

                                                                                                                                               6.25

      This implies that for a given mass and velocity, a large centripetal force causes a small radius of curvature—that is, a
      tight curve.




      FIGURE 6.9 The frictional force supplies the centripetal force and is numerically equal to it. Centripetal force is perpendicular to velocity
      and causes uniform circular motion. The larger the , the smaller the radius of curvature and the sharper the curve. The second curve
      has the same , but a larger    produces a smaller .


              EXAMPLE 6.4

      What Coefficient of Friction Do Car Tires Need on a Flat Curve?
      (a) Calculate the centripetal force exerted on a 900 kg car that negotiates a 500 m radius curve at 25.0 m/s.

      (b) Assuming an unbanked curve, find the minimum static coefficient of friction, between the tires and the road,
      static friction being the reason that keeps the car from slipping (see Figure 6.10).

      Strategy and Solution for (a)

      We know that                   . Thus,


                                                                                                                                               6.26

the car from slipping, and because it is the only horizontal force acting on the car, the friction is the centripetal force
in this case. We know that the maximum static friction (at which the tires roll but do not slip) is        , where    is the
static coefficient of friction and N is the normal force. The normal force equals the car’s weight on level ground, so
that           . Thus the centripetal force in this situation is
                                                                                                                      6.27
Now we have a relationship between centripetal force and the coefficient of friction. Using the first expression for
from the equation


                                                                                                                      6.28

We solve this for   , noting that mass cancels, and obtain

                                                                                                                      6.30

Solution for (b)

Substituting the knowns,

                                                                                                                      6.31

(Because coefficients of friction are approximate, the answer is given to only two digits.)

Discussion


We could also solve part (a) using the first expression in                   because        and are given. The

coefficient of friction found in part (b) is much smaller than is typically found between tires and roads. The car will
still negotiate the curve if the coefficient is greater than 0.13, because static friction is a responsive force, being able
to assume a value less than but no more than            . A higher coefficient would also allow the car to negotiate the
curve at a higher speed, but if the coefficient of friction is less, the safe speed would be less than 25 m/s. Note that
mass cancels, implying that in this example, it does not matter how heavily loaded the car is to negotiate the turn.
Mass cancels because friction is assumed proportional to the normal force, which in turn is proportional to mass. If
the surface of the road were banked, the normal force would be less as will be discussed below.
238   6 • Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation




      FIGURE 6.10 This car on level ground is moving away and turning to the left. The centripetal force causing the car to turn in a circular path
      is due to friction between the tires and the road. A minimum coefficient of friction is needed, or the car will move in a larger-radius curve
      and leave the roadway.

      Let us now consider banked curves, where the slope of the road helps you negotiate the curve. See Figure 6.11. The
      greater the angle , the faster you can take the curve. Race tracks for bikes as well as cars, for example, often have
      steeply banked curves. In an “ideally banked curve,” the angle is such that you can negotiate the curve at a certain
      speed without the aid of friction between the tires and the road. We will derive an expression for for an ideally
      banked curve and consider an example related to it.

      For ideal banking, the net external force equals the horizontal centripetal force in the absence of friction. The
      components of the normal force N in the horizontal and vertical directions must equal the centripetal force and the
      weight of the car, respectively. In cases in which forces are not parallel, it is most convenient to consider
      components along perpendicular axes—in this case, the vertical and horizontal directions.

      Figure 6.11 shows a free body diagram for a car on a frictionless banked curve. If the angle is ideal for the speed
      and radius, then the net external force will equal the necessary centripetal force. The only two external forces acting
      on the car are its weight and the normal force of the road . (A frictionless surface can only exert a force
      perpendicular to the surface—that is, a normal force.) These two forces must add to give a net external force that is
      horizontal toward the center of curvature and has magnitude         . Because this is the crucial force and it is
      horizontal, we use a coordinate system with vertical and horizontal axes. Only the normal force has a horizontal
      component, and so this must equal the centripetal force—that is,

                                                                                                                                             6.32

      Because the car does not leave the surface of the road, the net vertical force must be zero, meaning that the vertical
      components of the two external forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. From the figure, we
      see that the vertical component of the normal force is         , and the only other vertical force is the car’s weight.
      These must be equal in magnitude; thus,
                                                                                                                                             6.33
      Now we can combine the last two equations to eliminate     and get an expression for , as desired. Solving the
      second equation for               , and substituting this into the first yields

                                                                                                                                             6.34

Taking the inverse tangent gives

                                                                                                                           6.36

This expression can be understood by considering how depends on and . A large will be obtained for a large
and a small . That is, roads must be steeply banked for high speeds and sharp curves. Friction helps, because it
allows you to take the curve at greater or lower speed than if the curve is frictionless. Note that does not depend
on the mass of the vehicle.

         EXAMPLE 6.5

What Is the Ideal Speed to Take a Steeply Banked Tight Curve?
Curves on some test tracks and race courses, such as the Daytona International Speedway in Florida, are very
steeply banked. This banking, with the aid of tire friction and very stable car configurations, allows the curves to be
taken at very high speed. To illustrate, calculate the speed at which a 100 m radius curve banked at 65.0° should be
driven if the road is frictionless.

Strategy

We first note that all terms in the expression for the ideal angle of a banked curve except for speed are known; thus,
we need only rearrange it so that speed appears on the left-hand side and then substitute known quantities.

Noting that tan 65.0º = 2.14, we obtain

      Discussion

      This is just about 165 km/h, consistent with a very steeply banked and rather sharp curve. Tire friction enables a
      vehicle to take the curve at significantly higher speeds.

      Calculations similar to those in the preceding examples can be performed for a host of interesting situations in
      which centripetal force is involved—a number of these are presented in this chapter’s Problems and Exercises.

      6.4 Fictitious Forces and Non-inertial Frames: The Coriolis Force
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Discuss the inertial frame of reference.
       • Discuss the non-inertial frame of reference.
       • Describe the effects of the Coriolis force.

      What do taking off in a jet airplane, turning a corner in a car, riding a merry-go-round, and the circular motion of a
      tropical cyclone have in common? Each exhibits fictitious forces—unreal forces that arise from motion and may
      seem real, because the observer’s frame of reference is accelerating or rotating.

      When taking off in a jet, most people would agree it feels as if you are being pushed back into the seat as the
      airplane accelerates down the runway. Yet a physicist would say that you tend to remain stationary while the seat
      pushes forward on you, and there is no real force backward on you. An even more common experience occurs when
      you make a tight curve in your car—say, to the right. You feel as if you are thrown (that is, forced) toward the left
      relative to the car. Again, a physicist would say that you are going in a straight line but the car moves to the right, and
      there is no real force on you to the left. Recall Newton’s first law.

                                                                          6.4 • Fictitious Forces and Non-inertial Frames: The Coriolis Force          241




FIGURE 6.12 (a) The car driver feels herself forced to the left relative to the car when she makes a right turn. This is a fictitious force arising
from the use of the car as a frame of reference. (b) In the Earth’s frame of reference, the driver moves in a straight line, obeying Newton’s
first law, and the car moves to the right. There is no real force to the left on the driver relative to Earth. There is a real force to the right on
the car to make it turn.

We can reconcile these points of view by examining the frames of reference used. Let us concentrate on people in a
car. Passengers instinctively use the car as a frame of reference, while a physicist uses Earth. The physicist chooses
Earth because it is very nearly an inertial frame of reference—one in which all forces are real (that is, in which all
forces have an identifiable physical origin). In such a frame of reference, Newton’s laws of motion take the form
given in Dynamics: Newton's Laws of Motion The car is a non-inertial frame of reference because it is accelerated
to the side. The force to the left sensed by car passengers is a fictitious force having no physical origin. There is
nothing real pushing them left—the car, as well as the driver, is actually accelerating to the right.

Let us now take a mental ride on a merry-go-round—specifically, a rapidly rotating playground merry-go-round. You
take the merry-go-round to be your frame of reference because you rotate together. In that non-inertial frame, you
feel a fictitious force, named centrifugal force (not to be confused with centripetal force), trying to throw you off.
You must hang on tightly to counteract the centrifugal force. In Earth’s frame of reference, there is no force trying to
throw you off. Rather you must hang on to make yourself go in a circle because otherwise you would go in a straight
line, right off the merry-go-round.




FIGURE 6.13 (a) A rider on a merry-go-round feels as if he is being thrown off. This fictitious force is called the centrifugal force—it explains
the rider’s motion in the rotating frame of reference. (b) In an inertial frame of reference and according to Newton’s laws, it is his inertia that
carries him off and not a real force (the unshaded rider has             and heads in a straight line). A real force,         , is needed to
cause a circular path.

This inertial effect, carrying you away from the center of rotation if there is no centripetal force to cause circular
motion, is put to good use in centrifuges (see Figure 6.14). A centrifuge spins a sample very rapidly, as mentioned
242   6 • Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation



      earlier in this chapter. Viewed from the rotating frame of reference, the fictitious centrifugal force throws particles
      outward, hastening their sedimentation. The greater the angular velocity, the greater the centrifugal force. But what
      really happens is that the inertia of the particles carries them along a line tangent to the circle while the test tube is
      forced in a circular path by a centripetal force.




      FIGURE 6.14 Centrifuges use inertia to perform their task. Particles in the fluid sediment come out because their inertia carries them away
      from the center of rotation. The large angular velocity of the centrifuge quickens the sedimentation. Ultimately, the particles will come into
      contact with the test tube walls, which will then supply the centripetal force needed to make them move in a circle of constant radius.

      Let us now consider what happens if something moves in a frame of reference that rotates. For example, what if you
      slide a ball directly away from the center of the merry-go-round, as shown in Figure 6.15? The ball follows a straight
      path relative to Earth (assuming negligible friction) and a path curved to the right on the merry-go-round’s surface. A
      person standing next to the merry-go-round sees the ball moving straight and the merry-go-round rotating
      underneath it. In the merry-go-round’s frame of reference, we explain the apparent curve to the right by using a
      fictitious force, called the Coriolis force, that causes the ball to curve to the right. The fictitious Coriolis force can be
      used by anyone in that frame of reference to explain why objects follow curved paths and allows us to apply
      Newton’s Laws in non-inertial frames of reference.

FIGURE 6.15 Looking down on the counterclockwise rotation of a merry-go-round, we see that a ball slid straight toward the edge follows a
path curved to the right. The person slides the ball toward point B, starting at point A. Both points rotate to the shaded positions (A’ and B’)
shown in the time that the ball follows the curved path in the rotating frame and a straight path in Earth’s frame.

Up until now, we have considered Earth to be an inertial frame of reference with little or no worry about effects due
to its rotation. Yet such effects do exist—in the rotation of weather systems, for example. Most consequences of
Earth’s rotation can be qualitatively understood by analogy with the merry-go-round. Viewed from above the North
Pole, Earth rotates counterclockwise, as does the merry-go-round in Figure 6.15. As on the merry-go-round, any
motion in Earth’s northern hemisphere experiences a Coriolis force to the right. Just the opposite occurs in the
southern hemisphere; there, the force is to the left. Because Earth’s angular velocity is small, the Coriolis force is
usually negligible, but for large-scale motions, such as wind patterns, it has substantial effects.

The Coriolis force causes hurricanes in the northern hemisphere to rotate in the counterclockwise direction, while
the tropical cyclones (what hurricanes are called below the equator) in the southern hemisphere rotate in the
clockwise direction. The terms hurricane, typhoon, and tropical storm are regionally-specific names for tropical
cyclones, storm systems characterized by low pressure centers, strong winds, and heavy rains. Figure 6.16 helps
show how these rotations take place. Air flows toward any region of low pressure, and tropical cyclones contain
particularly low pressures. Thus winds flow toward the center of a tropical cyclone or a low-pressure weather
system at the surface. In the northern hemisphere, these inward winds are deflected to the right, as shown in the
figure, producing a counterclockwise circulation at the surface for low-pressure zones of any type. Low pressure at
the surface is associated with rising air, which also produces cooling and cloud formation, making low-pressure
patterns quite visible from space. Conversely, wind circulation around high-pressure zones is clockwise in the
northern hemisphere but is less visible because high pressure is associated with sinking air, producing clear skies.

The rotation of tropical cyclones and the path of a ball on a merry-go-round can just as well be explained by inertia
and the rotation of the system underneath. When non-inertial frames are used, fictitious forces, such as the Coriolis
force, must be invented to explain the curved path. There is no identifiable physical source for these fictitious forces.
In an inertial frame, inertia explains the path, and no force is found to be without an identifiable source. Either view
allows us to describe nature, but a view in an inertial frame is the simplest and truest, in the sense that all forces
have real origins and explanations.

      6.5 Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Explain Earth’s gravitational force.
       • Describe the gravitational effect of the Moon on Earth.
       • Discuss weightlessness in space.
       • Examine the Cavendish experiment

      What do aching feet, a falling apple, and the orbit of the Moon have in common? Each is caused by the gravitational
      force. Our feet are strained by supporting our weight—the force of Earth’s gravity on us. An apple falls from a tree
      because of the same force acting a few meters above Earth’s surface. And the Moon orbits Earth because gravity is
      able to supply the necessary centripetal force at a distance of hundreds of millions of meters. In fact, the same force
      causes planets to orbit the Sun, stars to orbit the center of the galaxy, and galaxies to cluster together. Gravity is
      another example of underlying simplicity in nature. It is the weakest of the four basic forces found in nature, and in
      some ways the least understood. It is a force that acts at a distance, without physical contact, and is expressed by a
      formula that is valid everywhere in the universe, for masses and distances that vary from the tiny to the immense.

      Sir Isaac Newton was the first scientist to precisely define the gravitational force, and to show that it could explain
      both falling bodies and astronomical motions. See Figure 6.17. But Newton was not the first to suspect that the
      same force caused both our weight and the motion of planets. His forerunner Galileo Galilei had contended that
      falling bodies and planetary motions had the same cause. Some of Newton’s contemporaries, such as Robert Hooke,
      Christopher Wren, and Edmund Halley, had also made some progress toward understanding gravitation. But Newton
      was the first to propose an exact mathematical form and to use that form to show that the motion of heavenly
      bodies should be conic sections—circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. This theoretical prediction was a
      major triumph—it had been known for some time that moons, planets, and comets follow such paths, but no one
      had been able to propose a mechanism that caused them to follow these paths and not others. Other prominent
      scientists and mathematicians of the time, particularly those outside of England, were reluctant to accept Newton's
      principles. It took the work of another prominent philosopher, writer, and scientist, Émilie du Châtelet, to establish
      the Newtonian gravitation as the accurate and overarching law. Du Châtelet, who had earlier laid the foundation for
      the understanding of conservation of energy as well as the principle that light had no mass, translated and
      augmented Newton's key work. She also utilized calculus to explain gravity, which helped lead to its acceptance.

FIGURE 6.17 According to early accounts, Newton was inspired to make the connection between falling bodies and astronomical motions
when he saw an apple fall from a tree and realized that if the gravitational force could extend above the ground to a tree, it might also reach
the Sun. The inspiration of Newton’s apple is a part of worldwide folklore and may even be based in fact. Newton’s universal law of
gravitation and his laws of motion answered very old questions about nature and gave tremendous support to the notion of underlying
simplicity and unity in nature. Like many revolutionary discoveries, it was not immediately accepted. Prominent French scientist and
philosopher Émilie du Châtelet helped establish Newton's theory in France and mainland Europe.

The gravitational force is relatively simple. It is always attractive, and it depends only on the masses involved and
the distance between them. Stated in modern language, Newton’s universal law of gravitation states that every
particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force along a line joining them. The force is directly
proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.




FIGURE 6.18 Gravitational attraction is along a line joining the centers of mass of these two bodies. The magnitude of the force is the same
on each, consistent with Newton’s third law.


  Misconception Alert
  The magnitude of the force on each object (one has larger mass than the other) is the same, consistent with
  Newton’s third law.


The bodies we are dealing with tend to be large. To simplify the situation we assume that the body acts as if its
entire mass is concentrated at one specific point called the center of mass (CM), which will be further explored in
Linear Momentum and Collisions. For two bodies having masses and            with a distance between their centers of
mass, the equation for Newton’s universal law of gravitation is

      masses in kilograms and distance in meters. For example, two 1.000 kg masses separated by 1.000 m will
      experience a gravitational attraction of                   . This is an extraordinarily small force. The small magnitude
      of the gravitational force is consistent with everyday experience. We are unaware that even large objects like
      mountains exert gravitational forces on us. In fact, our body weight is the force of attraction of the entire Earth on us
      with a mass of                .

      Recall that the acceleration due to gravity is about             on Earth. We can now determine why this is so. The
      weight of an object mg is the gravitational force between it and Earth. Substituting mg for in Newton’s universal
      law of gravitation gives

                                                                                                                                         6.42

                                                                                                                                         6.43

      Substituting known values for Earth’s mass and radius (to three significant figures),


                                                                                                                                         6.44

                                                                                                                                         6.45




      FIGURE 6.19 The distance between the centers of mass of Earth and an object on its surface is very nearly the same as the radius of Earth,
      because Earth is so much larger than the object.

      This is the expected value and is independent of the body’s mass. Newton’s law of gravitation takes Galileo’s
      observation that all masses fall with the same acceleration a step further, explaining the observation in terms of a
      force that causes objects to fall—in fact, in terms of a universally existing force of attraction between masses.

 Making Connections
 Attempts are still being made to understand the gravitational force. As we shall see in Particle Physics, modern
 physics is exploring the connections of gravity to other forces, space, and time. General relativity alters our view
 of gravitation, leading us to think of gravitation as bending space and time.


In the following example, we make a comparison similar to one made by Newton himself. He noted that if the
gravitational force caused the Moon to orbit Earth, then the acceleration due to gravity should equal the centripetal
acceleration of the Moon in its orbit. Newton found that the two accelerations agreed “pretty nearly.”


        EXAMPLE 6.6

Earth’s Gravitational Force Is the Centripetal Force Making the Moon Move in a Curved Path
(a) Find the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity at the distance of the Moon.

(b) Calculate the centripetal acceleration needed to keep the Moon in its orbit (assuming a circular orbit about a
fixed Earth), and compare it with the value of the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity that you have just found.

Strategy for (a)

This calculation is the same as the one finding the acceleration due to gravity at Earth’s surface, except that is the
distance from the center of Earth to the center of the Moon. The radius of the Moon’s nearly circular orbit is
               .

Solution for (a)

Substituting known values into the expression for    found above, remembering that        is the mass of Earth not the
Moon, yields


                                                                                                                    6.46


Strategy for (b)

Centripetal acceleration can be calculated using either form of


                                                                                                                    6.47


We choose to use the second form:

                                                                                                                    6.48

where    is the angular velocity of the Moon about Earth.

Solution for (b)

Given that the period (the time it takes to make one complete rotation) of the Moon’s orbit is 27.3 days, (d) and
using

                                                                                                                    6.49

we see that

248   6 • Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation



      The centripetal acceleration is


                                                                                                                                             6.51


      The direction of the acceleration is toward the center of the Earth.

      Discussion

      The centripetal acceleration of the Moon found in (b) differs by less than 1% from the acceleration due to Earth’s
      gravity found in (a). This agreement is approximate because the Moon’s orbit is slightly elliptical, and Earth is not
      stationary (rather the Earth-Moon system rotates about its center of mass, which is located some 1700 km below
      Earth’s surface). The clear implication is that Earth’s gravitational force causes the Moon to orbit Earth.


      Why does Earth not remain stationary as the Moon orbits it? This is because, as expected from Newton’s third law, if
      Earth exerts a force on the Moon, then the Moon should exert an equal and opposite force on Earth (see Figure
      6.20). We do not sense the Moon’s effect on Earth’s motion, because the Moon’s gravity moves our bodies right
      along with Earth but there are other signs on Earth that clearly show the effect of the Moon’s gravitational force as
      discussed in Satellites and Kepler's Laws: An Argument for Simplicity.




      FIGURE 6.20 (a) Earth and the Moon rotate approximately once a month around their common center of mass. (b) Their center of mass
      orbits the Sun in an elliptical orbit, but Earth’s path around the Sun has “wiggles” in it. Similar wiggles in the paths of stars have been
      observed and are considered direct evidence of planets orbiting those stars. This is important because the planets’ reflected light is often
      too dim to be observed.

      Tides
      Ocean tides are one very observable result of the Moon’s gravity acting on Earth. Figure 6.21 is a simplified drawing
      of the Moon’s position relative to the tides. Because water easily flows on Earth’s surface, a high tide is created on
      the side of Earth nearest to the Moon, where the Moon’s gravitational pull is strongest. Why is there also a high tide
      on the opposite side of Earth? The answer is that Earth is pulled toward the Moon more than the water on the far
      side, because Earth is closer to the Moon. So the water on the side of Earth closest to the Moon is pulled away from
      Earth, and Earth is pulled away from water on the far side. As Earth rotates, the tidal bulge (an effect of the tidal
      forces between an orbiting natural satellite and the primary planet that it orbits) keeps its orientation with the Moon.
      Thus there are two tides per day (the actual tidal period is about 12 hours and 25.2 minutes), because the Moon
      moves in its orbit each day as well).




      FIGURE 6.21 The Moon causes ocean tides by attracting the water on the near side more than Earth, and by attracting Earth more than the

water on the far side. The distances and sizes are not to scale. For this simplified representation of the Earth-Moon system, there are two
high and two low tides per day at any location, because Earth rotates under the tidal bulge.

The Sun also affects tides, although it has about half the effect of the Moon. However, the largest tides, called spring
tides, occur when Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are aligned. The smallest tides, called neap tides, occur when the
Sun is at a    angle to the Earth-Moon alignment.




FIGURE 6.22 (a, b) Spring tides: The highest tides occur when Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are aligned. (c) Neap tide: The lowest tides
occur when the Sun lies at    to the Earth-Moon alignment. Note that this figure is not drawn to scale.

Tides are not unique to Earth but occur in many astronomical systems. The most extreme tides occur where the
gravitational force is the strongest and varies most rapidly, such as near black holes (see Figure 6.23). A few likely
candidates for black holes have been observed in our galaxy. These have masses greater than the Sun but have
diameters only a few kilometers across. The tidal forces near them are so great that they can actually tear matter
from a companion star.




FIGURE 6.23 A black hole is an object with such strong gravity that not even light can escape it. This black hole was created by the
supernova of one star in a two-star system. The tidal forces created by the black hole are so great that it tears matter from the companion
star. This matter is compressed and heated as it is sucked into the black hole, creating light and X-rays observable from Earth.

”Weightlessness” and Microgravity
In contrast to the tremendous gravitational force near black holes is the apparent gravitational field experienced by
250   6 • Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation



      astronauts orbiting Earth. What is the effect of “weightlessness” upon an astronaut who is in orbit for months? Or
      what about the effect of weightlessness upon plant growth? Weightlessness doesn’t mean that an astronaut is not
      being acted upon by the gravitational force. There is no “zero gravity” in an astronaut’s orbit. The term just means
      that the astronaut is in free-fall, accelerating with the acceleration due to gravity. If an elevator cable breaks, the
      passengers inside will be in free fall and will experience weightlessness. You can experience short periods of
      weightlessness in some rides in amusement parks.




                   FIGURE 6.24 Astronauts experiencing weightlessness on board the International Space Station. (credit: NASA)

      Microgravity refers to an environment in which the apparent net acceleration of a body is small compared with that
      produced by Earth at its surface. Many interesting biology and physics topics have been studied over the past three
      decades in the presence of microgravity. Of immediate concern is the effect on astronauts of extended times in
      outer space, such as at the International Space Station. Researchers have observed that muscles will atrophy
      (waste away) in this environment. There is also a corresponding loss of bone mass. Study continues on
      cardiovascular adaptation to space flight. On Earth, blood pressure is usually higher in the feet than in the head,
      because the higher column of blood exerts a downward force on it, due to gravity. When standing, 70% of your blood
      is below the level of the heart, while in a horizontal position, just the opposite occurs. What difference does the
      absence of this pressure differential have upon the heart?

      Some findings in human physiology in space can be clinically important to the management of diseases back on
      Earth. On a somewhat negative note, spaceflight is known to affect the human immune system, possibly making the
      crew members more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Experiments flown in space also have shown that some
      bacteria grow faster in microgravity than they do on Earth. However, on a positive note, studies indicate that
      microbial antibiotic production can increase by a factor of two in space-grown cultures. One hopes to be able to
      understand these mechanisms so that similar successes can be achieved on the ground. In another area of physics
      space research, inorganic crystals and protein crystals have been grown in outer space that have much higher
      quality than any grown on Earth, so crystallography studies on their structure can yield much better results.

      Plants have evolved with the stimulus of gravity and with gravity sensors. Roots grow downward and shoots grow
      upward. Plants might be able to provide a life support system for long duration space missions by regenerating the
      atmosphere, purifying water, and producing food. Some studies have indicated that plant growth and development
      are not affected by gravity, but there is still uncertainty about structural changes in plants grown in a microgravity
      environment.

      The Cavendish Experiment: Then and Now
      As previously noted, the universal gravitational constant is determined experimentally. This definition was first
      done accurately by Henry Cavendish (1731–1810), an English scientist, in 1798, more than 100 years after Newton
      published his universal law of gravitation. The measurement of is very basic and important because it determines
      the strength of one of the four forces in nature. Cavendish’s experiment was very difficult because he measured the
      tiny gravitational attraction between two ordinary-sized masses (tens of kilograms at most), using apparatus like
      that in Figure 6.25. Remarkably, his value for differs by less than 1% from the best modern value.

One important consequence of knowing was that an accurate value for Earth’s mass could finally be obtained.
This was done by measuring the acceleration due to gravity as accurately as possible and then calculating the mass
of Earth   from the relationship Newton’s universal law of gravitation gives

                                                                                                                                   6.52

where is the mass of the object,     is the mass of Earth, and is the distance to the center of Earth (the distance
between the centers of mass of the object and Earth). See Figure 6.18. The mass of the object cancels, leaving an
equation for :

                                                                                                                                   6.53

Rearranging to solve for        yields

                                                                                                                                   6.54

So     can be calculated because all quantities on the right, including the radius of Earth , are known from direct
measurements. We shall see in Satellites and Kepler's Laws: An Argument for Simplicity that knowing also allows
for the determination of astronomical masses. Interestingly, of all the fundamental constants in physics, is by far
the least well determined.

The Cavendish experiment is also used to explore other aspects of gravity. One of the most interesting questions is
whether the gravitational force depends on substance as well as mass—for example, whether one kilogram of lead
exerts the same gravitational pull as one kilogram of water. A Hungarian scientist named Roland von Eötvös
pioneered this inquiry early in the 20th century. He found, with an accuracy of five parts per billion, that the
gravitational force does not depend on the substance. Such experiments continue today, and have improved upon
Eötvös’ measurements. Cavendish-type experiments such as those of Eric Adelberger and others at the University of
Washington, have also put severe limits on the possibility of a fifth force and have verified a major prediction of
general relativity—that gravitational energy contributes to rest mass. Ongoing measurements there use a torsion
balance and a parallel plate (not spheres, as Cavendish used) to examine how Newton’s law of gravitation works
over sub-millimeter distances. On this small-scale, do gravitational effects depart from the inverse square law? So
far, no deviation has been observed.




FIGURE 6.25 Cavendish used an apparatus like this to measure the gravitational attraction between the two suspended spheres ( ) and
the two on the stand ( ) by observing the amount of torsion (twisting) created in the fiber. Distance between the masses can be varied to
check the dependence of the force on distance. Modern experiments of this type continue to explore gravity.

      6.6 Satellites and Kepler’s Laws: An Argument for Simplicity
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • State Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.
       • Derive the third Kepler’s law for circular orbits.
       • Discuss the Ptolemaic model of the universe.

      Examples of gravitational orbits abound. Hundreds of artificial satellites orbit Earth together with thousands of
      pieces of debris. The Moon’s orbit about Earth has intrigued humans from time immemorial. The orbits of planets,
      asteroids, meteors, and comets about the Sun are no less interesting. If we look further, we see almost
      unimaginable numbers of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects orbiting one another and interacting through
      gravity.

      All these motions are governed by gravitational force, and it is possible to describe them to various degrees of
      precision. Precise descriptions of complex systems must be made with large computers. However, we can describe
      an important class of orbits without the use of computers, and we shall find it instructive to study them. These orbits
      have the following characteristics:

      1. A small mass orbits a much larger mass . This allows us to view the motion as if        were stationary—in
         fact, as if from an inertial frame of reference placed on —without significant error. Mass is the satellite of
            , if the orbit is gravitationally bound.
      2. The system is isolated from other masses. This allows us to neglect any small effects due to outside masses.

      The conditions are satisfied, to good approximation, by Earth’s satellites (including the Moon), by objects orbiting
      the Sun, and by the satellites of other planets. Historically, planets were studied first, and there is a classical set of
      three laws, called Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, that describe the orbits of all bodies satisfying the two previous
      conditions (not just planets in our solar system). These descriptive laws are named for the German astronomer
      Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), who devised them after careful study (over some 20 years) of a large amount of
      meticulously recorded observations of planetary motion done by Tycho Brahe (1546–1601). Such careful collection
      and detailed recording of methods and data are hallmarks of good science. Data constitute the evidence from which
      new interpretations and meanings can be constructed.

      Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion
      Kepler’s First Law

      The orbit of each planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.




      Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                            6.6 • Satellites and Kepler’s Laws: An Argument for Simplicity         253




FIGURE 6.26 (a) An ellipse is a closed curve such that the sum of the distances from a point on the curve to the two foci ( and ) is a
constant. You can draw an ellipse as shown by putting a pin at each focus, and then placing a string around a pencil and the pins and tracing
a line on paper. A circle is a special case of an ellipse in which the two foci coincide (thus any point on the circle is the same distance from
the center). (b) For any closed gravitational orbit, follows an elliptical path with       at one focus. Kepler’s first law states this fact for
planets orbiting the Sun.

Kepler’s Second Law

Each planet moves so that an imaginary line drawn from the Sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times
(see Figure 6.27).

Kepler’s Third Law

The ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets about the Sun is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their
average distances from the Sun. In equation form, this is


                                                                                                                                        6.55


where is the period (time for one orbit) and is the average radius. This equation is valid only for comparing two
small masses orbiting the same large one. Most importantly, this is a descriptive equation only, giving no information
as to the cause of the equality.

      moves fastest when it is closest to . Kepler’s second law was originally devised for planets orbiting the Sun, but it has broader validity.

      Note again that while, for historical reasons, Kepler’s laws are stated for planets orbiting the Sun, they are actually
      valid for all bodies satisfying the two previously stated conditions.


                EXAMPLE 6.7

      Find the Time for One Orbit of an Earth Satellite
      Given that the Moon orbits Earth each 27.3 d and that it is an average distance of                   from the center of
      Earth, calculate the period of an artificial satellite orbiting at an average altitude of 1500 km above Earth’s surface.

      Strategy

      The period, or time for one orbit, is related to the radius of the orbit by Kepler’s third law, given in mathematical

      form in                . Let us use the subscript 1 for the Moon and the subscript 2 for the satellite. We are asked to find

         . The given information tells us that the orbital radius of the Moon is                       , and that the period of
      the Moon is              . The height of the artificial satellite above Earth’s surface is given, and so we must add the
      radius of Earth (6380 km) to get                                         . Now all quantities are known, and so       can
      be found.

      Solution

      Kepler’s third law is


                                                                                                                                             6.56


      To solve for      , we cross-multiply and take the square root, yielding


                                                                                                                                             6.57

Discussion
This is a reasonable period for a satellite in a fairly low orbit. It is interesting that any satellite at this altitude will
orbit in the same amount of time. This fact is related to the condition that the satellite’s mass is small compared

People immediately search for deeper meaning when broadly applicable laws, like Kepler’s, are discovered. It was
Newton who took the next giant step when he proposed the law of universal gravitation. While Kepler was able to
discover what was happening, Newton discovered that gravitational force was the cause.

Derivation of Kepler’s Third Law for Circular Orbits
We shall derive Kepler’s third law, starting with Newton’s laws of motion and his universal law of gravitation. The
point is to demonstrate that the force of gravity is the cause for Kepler’s laws (although we will only derive the third
one).

Let us consider a circular orbit of a small mass around a large mass , satisfying the two conditions stated at the
beginning of this section. Gravity supplies the centripetal force to mass . Starting with Newton’s second law
applied to circular motion,

                                                                                                                           6.60

The net external force on mass       is gravity, and so we substitute the force of gravity for        :

                                                                                                                           6.61

The mass      cancels, yielding

                                                                                                                           6.62

The fact that cancels out is another aspect of the oft-noted fact that at a given location all masses fall with the
same acceleration. Here we see that at a given orbital radius , all masses orbit at the same speed. (This was
implied by the result of the preceding worked example.) Now, to get at Kepler’s third law, we must get the period
into the equation. By definition, period is the time for one complete orbit. Now the average speed is the
circumference divided by the period—that is,

                                                                                                                           6.63

Substituting this into the previous equation gives

                                                                                                                           6.64

Solving for     yields

                                                                                                                           6.65

Using subscripts 1 and 2 to denote two different satellites, and taking the ratio of the last equation for satellite 1 to
satellite 2 yields


                                                                                                                           6.66
256   6 • Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation



      This is Kepler’s third law. Note that Kepler’s third law is valid only for comparing satellites of the same parent body,
      because only then does the mass of the parent body          cancel.

      Now consider what we get if we solve                    for the ratio       . We obtain a relationship that can be used to
      determine the mass        of a parent body from the orbits of its satellites:

                                                                                                                             6.67

      If and are known for a satellite, then the mass        of the parent can be calculated. This principle has been used
      extensively to find the masses of heavenly bodies that have satellites. Furthermore, the ratio         should be a
      constant for all satellites of the same parent body (because                    ). (See Table 6.2).

      It is clear from Table 6.2 that the ratio of      is constant, at least to the third digit, for all listed satellites of the
      Sun, and for those of Jupiter. Small variations in that ratio have two causes—uncertainties in the and data, and
      perturbations of the orbits due to other bodies. Interestingly, those perturbations can be—and have been—used to
      predict the location of new planets and moons. This is another verification of Newton’s universal law of gravitation.


        Making Connections
        Newton’s universal law of gravitation is modified by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, as we shall see in
        Particle Physics. Newton’s gravity is not seriously in error—it was and still is an extremely good approximation
        for most situations. Einstein’s modification is most noticeable in extremely large gravitational fields, such as
        near black holes. However, general relativity also explains such phenomena as small but long-known deviations
        of the orbit of the planet Mercury from classical predictions.


      The Case for Simplicity
      The development of the universal law of gravitation by Newton played a pivotal role in the history of ideas. While it is
      beyond the scope of this text to cover that history in any detail, we note some important points. The definition of
      planet set in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) states that in the solar system, a planet is a
      celestial body that:

      1. is in orbit around the Sun,
      2. has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium and
      3. has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.

      A non-satellite body fulfilling only the first two of the above criteria is classified as “dwarf planet.”

      In 2006, Pluto was demoted to a ‘dwarf planet’ after scientists revised their definition of what constitutes a “true”
      planet.

           TABLE 6.2 Orbital Data and Kepler’s Third Law

The universal law of gravitation is a good example of a physical principle that is very broadly applicable. That single
equation for the gravitational force describes all situations in which gravity acts. It gives a cause for a vast number of
effects, such as the orbits of the planets and moons in the solar system. It epitomizes the underlying unity and
simplicity of physics.

Before the discoveries of Kepler, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, and others, the solar system was thought to revolve
around Earth as shown in Figure 6.28(a). This is called the Ptolemaic view, for the Greek philosopher who lived in
the second century AD. This model is characterized by a list of facts for the motions of planets with no cause and
effect explanation. There tended to be a different rule for each heavenly body and a general lack of simplicity.

Figure 6.28(b) represents the modern or Copernican model. In this model, a small set of rules and a single
underlying force explain not only all motions in the solar system, but all other situations involving gravity. The
breadth and simplicity of the laws of physics are compelling. As our knowledge of nature has grown, the basic
simplicity of its laws has become ever more evident.




FIGURE 6.28 (a) The Ptolemaic model of the universe has Earth at the center with the Moon, the planets, the Sun, and the stars revolving
about it in complex superpositions of circular paths. This geocentric model, which can be made progressively more accurate by adding
more circles, is purely descriptive, containing no hints as to what are the causes of these motions. (b) The Copernican model has the Sun at
the center of the solar system. It is fully explained by a small number of laws of physics, including Newton’s universal law of gravitation.

      Race car drivers will take the inside path (called cutting the
      corner) whenever possible because it allows them to take the
      curve at the highest speed.

7. A number of amusement parks have rides that make
   vertical loops like the one shown in Figure 6.30. For
   safety, the cars are attached to the rails in such a way
   that they cannot fall off. If the car goes over the top at
   just the right speed, gravity alone will supply the
   centripetal force. What other force acts and what is its
   direction if:
   (a) The car goes over the top at faster than this speed?
   (b)The car goes over the top at slower than this speed?

INTRODUCTION TO WORK, ENERGY, AND ENERGY RESOURCES Energy plays an essential role both in everyday
events and in scientific phenomena. You can no doubt name many forms of energy, from that provided by our foods,
to the energy we use to run our cars, to the sunlight that warms us on the beach. You can also cite examples of what
people call energy that may not be scientific, such as someone having an energetic personality. Not only does
energy have many interesting forms, it is involved in almost all phenomena, and is one of the most important
concepts of physics. What makes it even more important is that the total amount of energy in the universe is
constant. Energy can change forms, but it cannot appear from nothing or disappear without a trace. Energy is thus
one of a handful of physical quantities that we say is conserved.

Conservation of energy (as physicists like to call the principle that energy can neither be created nor destroyed) is
based on experiment. For example, scientists Willem ’s Gravesande and Émilie du Châtelet undertook (separate)
experiments where they dropped heavy lead balls into beds of clay. Du Châtelet showed that the balls that hit the
clay with twice the velocity penetrated four times as deep into the clay; those with three times the velocity reached
a depth nine times greater. This led her to develop a more accurate concept of energy conservation, expressed as
            . Even as scientists discovered new forms of energy, conservation of energy has always been found to
apply. Perhaps the most dramatic example of this was supplied by Einstein when he suggested that mass is
equivalent to energy (his famous equation         ).

From a societal viewpoint, energy is one of the major building blocks of modern civilization. Energy resources are
270   7 • Work, Energy, and Energy Resources



      key limiting factors to economic growth. The world use of energy resources, especially oil, continues to grow, with
      ominous consequences economically, socially, politically, and environmentally. We will briefly examine the world’s
      energy use patterns at the end of this chapter.

      There is no simple, yet accurate, scientific definition for energy. Energy is characterized by its many forms and the
      fact that it is conserved. We can loosely define energy as the ability to do work, admitting that in some
      circumstances not all energy is available to do work. Because of the association of energy with work, we begin the
      chapter with a discussion of work. Work is intimately related to energy and how energy moves from one system to
      another or changes form.

      7.1 Work: The Scientific Definition
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Explain how an object must be displaced for a force on it to do work.
       • Explain how relative directions of force and displacement determine whether the work done is positive,
          negative, or zero.

      What It Means to Do Work
      The scientific definition of work differs in some ways from its everyday meaning. Certain things we think of as hard
      work, such as writing an exam or carrying a heavy load on level ground, are not work as defined by a scientist. The
      scientific definition of work reveals its relationship to energy—whenever work is done, energy is transferred.

      For work, in the scientific sense, to be done, a force must be exerted and there must be displacement in the
      direction of the force.

      Formally, the work done on a system by a constant force is defined to be the product of the component of the force
      in the direction of motion times the distance through which the force acts. For one-way motion in one dimension,
      this is expressed in equation form as
                                                                                                                         7.1
      where    is work, is the displacement of the system, and is the angle between the force vector          and the
      displacement vector , as in Figure 7.2. We can also write this as
                                                                                                                         7.2
      To find the work done on a system that undergoes motion that is not one-way or that is in two or three dimensions,
      we divide the motion into one-way one-dimensional segments and add up the work done over each segment.


        What is Work?
        The work done on a system by a constant force is the product of the component of the force in the direction of
        motion times the distance through which the force acts. For one-way motion in one dimension, this is expressed
        in equation form as
                                                                                                                        7.3
        where     is work, is the magnitude of the force on the system, is the magnitude of the displacement of the
        system, and is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector .

no energy to it. (d) Work is done on the briefcase by carrying it up stairs at constant speed, because there is necessarily a component of
force in the direction of the motion. Energy is transferred to the briefcase and could in turn be used to do work. (e) When the briefcase is
lowered, energy is transferred out of the briefcase and into an electric generator. Here the work done on the briefcase by the generator is
negative, removing energy from the briefcase, because and are in opposite directions.

To examine what the definition of work means, let us consider the other situations shown in Figure 7.2. The person
holding the briefcase in Figure 7.2(b) does no work, for example. Here      , so       . Why is it you get tired just
holding a load? The answer is that your muscles are doing work against one another, but they are doing no work on
the system of interest (the “briefcase-Earth system”—see Gravitational Potential Energy for more details). There
must be displacement for work to be done, and there must be a component of the force in the direction of the
272   7 • Work, Energy, and Energy Resources



      motion. For example, the person carrying the briefcase on level ground in Figure 7.2(c) does no work on it, because
      the force is perpendicular to the motion. That is,          , and so         .

      In contrast, when a force exerted on the system has a component in the direction of motion, such as in Figure 7.2(d),
      work is done—energy is transferred to the briefcase. Finally, in Figure 7.2(e), energy is transferred from the briefcase
      to a generator. There are two good ways to interpret this energy transfer. One interpretation is that the briefcase’s
      weight does work on the generator, giving it energy. The other interpretation is that the generator does negative
      work on the briefcase, thus removing energy from it. The drawing shows the latter, with the force from the generator
      upward on the briefcase, and the displacement downward. This makes                 , and                 ; therefore,
      is negative.

      Calculating Work
      Work and energy have the same units. From the definition of work, we see that those units are force times distance.
      Thus, in SI units, work and energy are measured in newton-meters. A newton-meter is given the special name joule
      (J), and                               . One joule is not a large amount of energy; it would lift a small 100-gram
      apple a distance of about 1 meter.


              EXAMPLE 7.1

      Calculating the Work You Do to Push a Lawn Mower Across a Large Lawn
      How much work is done on the lawn mower by the person in Figure 7.2(a) if he exerts a constant force of            at
      an angle      below the horizontal and pushes the mower           on level ground? Convert the amount of work from
      joules to kilocalories and compare it with this person’s average daily intake of         (about            ) of food
      energy. One calorie (1 cal) of heat is the amount required to warm 1 g of water by   , and is equivalent to          ,
      while one food calorie (1 kcal) is equivalent to       .

      Strategy

      We can solve this problem by substituting the given values into the definition of work done on a system, stated in the
      equation                . The force, angle, and displacement are given, so that only the work     is unknown.

      Solution

      The equation for the work is
                                                                                                                         7.4
      Substituting the known values gives

                                                                                                                         7.5

      Converting the work in joules to kilocalories yields                                            . The ratio of the work
      done to the daily consumption is

                                                                                                                         7.6

      Discussion

      This ratio is a tiny fraction of what the person consumes, but it is typical. Very little of the energy released in the
      consumption of food is used to do work. Even when we “work” all day long, less than 10% of our food energy intake
      is used to do work and more than 90% is converted to thermal energy or stored as chemical energy in fat.

7.2 Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Explain work as a transfer of energy and net work as the work done by the net force.
 • Explain and apply the work-energy theorem.

Work Transfers Energy
What happens to the work done on a system? Energy is transferred into the system, but in what form? Does it
remain in the system or move on? The answers depend on the situation. For example, if the lawn mower in Figure
7.2(a) is pushed just hard enough to keep it going at a constant speed, then energy put into the mower by the person
is removed continuously by friction, and eventually leaves the system in the form of heat transfer. In contrast, work
done on the briefcase by the person carrying it up stairs in Figure 7.2(d) is stored in the briefcase-Earth system and
can be recovered at any time, as shown in Figure 7.2(e). In fact, the building of the pyramids in ancient Egypt is an
example of storing energy in a system by doing work on the system. Some of the energy imparted to the stone
blocks in lifting them during construction of the pyramids remains in the stone-Earth system and has the potential to
do work.

In this section we begin the study of various types of work and forms of energy. We will find that some types of work
leave the energy of a system constant, for example, whereas others change the system in some way, such as making
it move. We will also develop definitions of important forms of energy, such as the energy of motion.

Net Work and the Work-Energy Theorem
We know from the study of Newton’s laws in Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion that net force causes
acceleration. We will see in this section that work done by the net force gives a system energy of motion, and in the
process we will also find an expression for the energy of motion.

Let us start by considering the total, or net, work done on a system. Net work is defined to be the sum of work on an
object. The net work can be written in terms of the net force on an object.     . In equation form, this is
                      where is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector.

Figure 7.3(a) shows a graph of force versus displacement for the component of the force in the direction of the
displacement—that is, an            vs. graph. In this case,         is constant. You can see that the area under the
graph is          , or the work done. Figure 7.3(b) shows a more general process where the force varies. The area
under the curve is divided into strips, each having an average force                . The work done is
                  for each strip, and the total work done is the sum of the   . Thus the total work done is the total
area under the curve, a useful property to which we shall refer later.

      graph of         vs. in which the force varies. The work done for each interval is the area of each strip; thus, the total area under the
      curve equals the total work done.

      Net work will be simpler to examine if we consider a one-dimensional situation where a force is used to accelerate
      an object in a direction parallel to its initial velocity. Such a situation occurs for the package on the roller belt
      conveyor system shown in Figure 7.4.




                                  FIGURE 7.4 A package on a roller belt is pushed horizontally through a distance .

      The force of gravity and the normal force acting on the package are perpendicular to the displacement and do no
      work. Moreover, they are also equal in magnitude and opposite in direction so they cancel in calculating the net
      force. The net force arises solely from the horizontal applied force    and the horizontal friction force . Thus, as
      expected, the net force is parallel to the displacement, so that                   and               , and the net work is given by
                                                                                                                                            7.7
      The effect of the net force      is to accelerate the package from   to . The kinetic energy of the package
      increases, indicating that the net work done on the system is positive. (See Example 7.2.) By using Newton’s second
      law, and doing some algebra, we can reach an interesting conclusion. Substituting              from Newton’s second
      law gives
                                                                                                                                            7.8
      To get a relationship between net work and the speed given to a system by the net force acting on it, we take
                   and use the equation studied in Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension for the
      change in speed over a distance if the acceleration has the constant value ; namely,                     (note that

      appears in the expression for the net work). Solving for acceleration gives                            . When      is substituted into

                                                                                                                    7.9

The   cancels, and we rearrange this to obtain

                                                                                                                   7.10

This expression is called the work-energy theorem, and it actually applies in general (even for forces that vary in
direction and magnitude), although we have derived it for the special case of a constant force parallel to the
displacement. The theorem implies that the net work on a system equals the change in the quantity            . This
quantity is our first example of a form of energy.


  The Work-Energy Theorem
  The net work on a system equals the change in the quantity          .

                                                                                                                 7.11



The quantity         in the work-energy theorem is defined to be the translational kinetic energy (KE) of a mass
moving at a speed . (Translational kinetic energy is distinct from rotational kinetic energy, which is considered
later.) In equation form, the translational kinetic energy,

                                                                                                                   7.12

is the energy associated with translational motion. Kinetic energy is a form of energy associated with the motion of a
particle, single body, or system of objects moving together.

We are aware that it takes energy to get an object, like a car or the package in Figure 7.4, up to speed, but it may be
a bit surprising that kinetic energy is proportional to speed squared. This proportionality means, for example, that a
car traveling at 100 km/h has four times the kinetic energy it has at 50 km/h, helping to explain why high-speed
collisions are so devastating. We will now consider a series of examples to illustrate various aspects of work and
energy.


       EXAMPLE 7.2

Calculating the Kinetic Energy of a Package
Suppose a 30.0-kg package on the roller belt conveyor system in Figure 7.4 is moving at 0.500 m/s. What is its
kinetic energy?

Strategy

Because the mass      and speed    are given, the kinetic energy can be calculated from its definition as given in the
equation               .

Solution

The kinetic energy is given by

                                                                                                                   7.13

Entering known values gives

                                                                                                                   7.14
276   7 • Work, Energy, and Energy Resources



      which yields

                                                                                                                           7.15

      Discussion

      Note that the unit of kinetic energy is the joule, the same as the unit of work, as mentioned when work was first
      defined. It is also interesting that, although this is a fairly massive package, its kinetic energy is not large at this
      relatively low speed. This fact is consistent with the observation that people can move packages like this without
      exhausting themselves.



              EXAMPLE 7.3

      Determining the Work to Accelerate a Package
      Suppose that you push on the 30.0-kg package in Figure 7.4 with a constant force of 120 N through a distance of
      0.800 m, and that the opposing friction force averages 5.00 N.

      (a) Calculate the net work done on the package. (b) Solve the same problem as in part (a), this time by finding the
      work done by each force that contributes to the net force.

      Strategy and Concept for (a)

      This is a motion in one dimension problem, because the downward force (from the weight of the package) and the
      normal force have equal magnitude and opposite direction, so that they cancel in calculating the net force, while the
      applied force, friction, and the displacement are all horizontal. (See Figure 7.4.) As expected, the net work is the net
      force times distance.

      Solution for (a)

      The net force is the push force minus friction, or                                    . Thus the net work is

                                                                                                                           7.16

      Discussion for (a)

      This value is the net work done on the package. The person actually does more work than this, because friction
      opposes the motion. Friction does negative work and removes some of the energy the person expends and converts
      it to thermal energy. The net work equals the sum of the work done by each individual force.

      Strategy and Concept for (b)

      The forces acting on the package are gravity, the normal force, the force of friction, and the applied force. The
      normal force and force of gravity are each perpendicular to the displacement, and therefore do no work.

      Solution for (b)

      The applied force does work.


                                                                                                                           7.17


      The friction force and displacement are in opposite directions, so that             , and the work done by friction is


                                                                                                                           7.18

So the amounts of work done by gravity, by the normal force, by the applied force, and by friction are, respectively,



                                                                                                                  7.19



The total work done as the sum of the work done by each force is then seen to be

                                                                                                                  7.20

Discussion for (b)

The calculated total work       as the sum of the work by each force agrees, as expected, with the work          done
by the net force. The work done by a collection of forces acting on an object can be calculated by either approach.



        EXAMPLE 7.4

Determining Speed from Work and Energy
Find the speed of the package in Figure 7.4 at the end of the push, using work and energy concepts.

Strategy

Here the work-energy theorem can be used, because we have just calculated the net work,       , and the initial
kinetic energy,       . These calculations allow us to find the final kinetic energy, , and thus the final speed
 .

Solution

The work-energy theorem in equation form is

                                                                                                                  7.21

Solving for       gives

                                                                                                                  7.22

Thus,

                                                                                                                  7.23

Solving for the final speed as requested and entering known values gives


                                                                                                                  7.24


Discussion

Using work and energy, we not only arrive at an answer, we see that the final kinetic energy is the sum of the initial
kinetic energy and the net work done on the package. This means that the work indeed adds to the energy of the
package.

               EXAMPLE 7.5

      Work and Energy Can Reveal Distance, Too
      How far does the package in Figure 7.4 coast after the push, assuming friction remains constant? Use work and
      energy considerations.

      Strategy

      We know that once the person stops pushing, friction will bring the package to rest. In terms of energy, friction does
      negative work until it has removed all of the package’s kinetic energy. The work done by friction is the force of
      friction times the distance traveled times the cosine of the angle between the friction force and displacement;
      hence, this gives us a way of finding the distance traveled after the person stops pushing.

      Solution

      The normal force and force of gravity cancel in calculating the net force. The horizontal friction force is then the net
      force, and it acts opposite to the displacement, so           . To reduce the kinetic energy of the package to zero, the
      work       by friction must be minus the kinetic energy that the package started with plus what the package
      accumulated due to the pushing. Thus                     . Furthermore,                             , where is the
      distance it takes to stop. Thus,

                                                                                                                        7.25

      and so
                                                                                                                        7.26
      Discussion

      This is a reasonable distance for a package to coast on a relatively friction-free conveyor system. Note that the work
      done by friction is negative (the force is in the opposite direction of motion), so it removes the kinetic energy.


      Some of the examples in this section can be solved without considering energy, but at the expense of missing out on
      gaining insights about what work and energy are doing in this situation. On the whole, solutions involving energy are
      generally shorter and easier than those using kinematics and dynamics alone.

      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Explain gravitational potential energy in terms of work done against gravity.
       • Show that the gravitational potential energy of an object of mass at height        on Earth is given by
                       .
       • Show how knowledge of the potential energy as a function of position can be used to simplify calculations
         and explain physical phenomena.

      Work Done Against Gravity
      Climbing stairs and lifting objects is work in both the scientific and everyday sense—it is work done against the
      gravitational force. When there is work, there is a transformation of energy. The work done against the gravitational
      force goes into an important form of stored energy that we will explore in this section.

      Let us calculate the work done in lifting an object of mass through a height , such as in Figure 7.5. If the object is
      lifted straight up at constant speed, then the force needed to lift it is equal to its weight . The work done on the
      mass is then                   . We define this to be the gravitational potential energy         put into (or gained by)
      the object-Earth system. This energy is associated with the state of separation between two objects that attract
      each other by the gravitational force. For convenience, we refer to this as the    gained by the object, recognizing

that this is energy stored in the gravitational field of Earth. Why do we use the word “system”? Potential energy is a
property of a system rather than of a single object—due to its physical position. An object’s gravitational potential is
due to its position relative to the surroundings within the Earth-object system. The force applied to the object is an
external force, from outside the system. When it does positive work it increases the gravitational potential energy of
the system. Because gravitational potential energy depends on relative position, we need a reference level at which
to set the potential energy equal to 0. We usually choose this point to be Earth’s surface, but this point is arbitrary;
what is important is the difference in gravitational potential energy, because this difference is what relates to the
work done. The difference in gravitational potential energy of an object (in the Earth-object system) between two
rungs of a ladder will be the same for the first two rungs as for the last two rungs.

Converting Between Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy
Gravitational potential energy may be converted to other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy. If we release the
mass, gravitational force will do an amount of work equal to     on it, thereby increasing its kinetic energy by that
same amount (by the work-energy theorem). We will find it more useful to consider just the conversion of         to
without explicitly considering the intermediate step of work. (See Example 7.7.) This shortcut makes it is easier to
solve problems using energy (if possible) rather than explicitly using forces.




FIGURE 7.5 (a) The work done to lift the weight is stored in the mass-Earth system as gravitational potential energy. (b) As the weight
moves downward, this gravitational potential energy is transferred to the cuckoo clock.

More precisely, we define the change in gravitational potential energy                       to be

                                                                                                                                      7.27

where, for simplicity, we denote the change in height by rather than the usual          . Note that is positive when the
final height is greater than the initial height, and vice versa. For example, if a 0.500-kg mass hung from a cuckoo
clock is raised 1.00 m, then its change in gravitational potential energy is


                                                                                                                                      7.28


Note that the units of gravitational potential energy turn out to be joules, the same as for work and other forms of
energy. As the clock runs, the mass is lowered. We can think of the mass as gradually giving up its 4.90 J of

      gravitational potential energy, without directly considering the force of gravity that does the work.

      Using Potential Energy to Simplify Calculations
      The equation                      applies for any path that has a change in height of , not just when the mass is lifted
      straight up. (See Figure 7.6.) It is much easier to calculate    (a simple multiplication) than it is to calculate the
      work done along a complicated path. The idea of gravitational potential energy has the double advantage that it is
      very broadly applicable and it makes calculations easier. From now on, we will consider that any change in vertical
      position of a mass is accompanied by a change in gravitational potential energy            , and we will avoid the
      equivalent but more difficult task of calculating work done by or against the gravitational force.




      FIGURE 7.6 The change in gravitational potential energy            between points A and B is independent of the path.               for any
      path between the two points. Gravity is one of a small class of forces where the work done by or against the force depends only on the
      starting and ending points, not on the path between them.


              EXAMPLE 7.6

      The Force to Stop Falling
      A 60.0-kg person jumps onto the floor from a height of 3.00 m. If he lands stiffly (with his knee joints compressing
      by 0.500 cm), calculate the force on the knee joints.

      Strategy

      This person’s energy is brought to zero in this situation by the work done on him by the floor as he stops. The initial
           is transformed into    as he falls. The work done by the floor reduces this kinetic energy to zero.

      Solution

      The work done on the person by the floor as he stops is given by
                                                                                                                                          7.29
      with a minus sign because the displacement while stopping and the force from floor are in opposite directions
                              . The floor removes energy from the system, so it does negative work.

      The kinetic energy the person has upon reaching the floor is the amount of potential energy lost by falling through

The distance that the person’s knees bend is much smaller than the height                    of the fall, so the additional change in
gravitational potential energy during the knee bend is ignored.

The work       done by the floor on the person stops the person and brings the person’s kinetic energy to zero:
                                                                                                                                  7.31
Combining this equation with the expression for              gives
                                                                                                                                  7.32
Recalling that     is negative because the person fell down, the force on the knee joints is given by

                                                                                                                                  7.33


Discussion

Such a large force (500 times more than the person’s weight) over the short impact time is enough to break bones. A
much better way to cushion the shock is by bending the legs or rolling on the ground, increasing the time over which
the force acts. A bending motion of 0.5 m this way yields a force 100 times smaller than in the example. A
kangaroo's hopping shows this method in action. The kangaroo is the only large animal to use hopping for
locomotion, but the shock in hopping is cushioned by the bending of its hind legs in each jump.(See Figure 7.7.)




FIGURE 7.7 The work done by the ground upon the kangaroo reduces its kinetic energy to zero as it lands. However, by applying the force of
the ground on the hind legs over a longer distance, the impact on the bones is reduced. (credit: Chris Samuel, Flickr)

Finding the Speed of a Roller Coaster from its Height
(a) What is the final speed of the roller coaster shown in Figure 7.8 if it starts from rest at the top of the 20.0 m hill
and work done by frictional forces is negligible? (b) What is its final speed (again assuming negligible friction) if its
initial speed is 5.00 m/s?
282   7 • Work, Energy, and Energy Resources




      FIGURE 7.8 The speed of a roller coaster increases as gravity pulls it downhill and is greatest at its lowest point. Viewed in terms of energy,
      the roller-coaster-Earth system’s gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. If work done by friction is negligible, all
      is converted to    .

      Strategy

      The roller coaster loses potential energy as it goes downhill. We neglect friction, so that the remaining force exerted
      by the track is the normal force, which is perpendicular to the direction of motion and does no work. The net work on
      the roller coaster is then done by gravity alone. The loss of gravitational potential energy from moving downward
      through a distance equals the gain in kinetic energy. This can be written in equation form as                     .
      Using the equations for            and      , we can solve for the final speed , which is the desired quantity.

      Solution for (a)

      Here the initial kinetic energy is zero, so that                         . The equation for change in potential energy states that
                       . Since    is negative in this case, we will rewrite this as                              to show the minus sign
      clearly. Thus,

                                                                                                                                              7.34

      Solving for , we find that mass cancels and that

                                                                                                                                              7.36

      Substituting known values,


                                                                                                                                              7.37


      Solution for (b)

      Again                       . In this case there is initial kinetic energy, so                                     . Thus,

                                                                                                                                              7.38

      Rearranging gives

                                                                                                                                              7.39

      This means that the final kinetic energy is the sum of the initial kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy.

                                                                                                                             7.40

This equation is very similar to the kinematics equation                  , but it is more general—the kinematics
equation is valid only for constant acceleration, whereas our equation above is valid for any path regardless of
whether the object moves with a constant acceleration. Now, substituting known values gives


                                                                                                                             7.41


Discussion and Implications

First, note that mass cancels. This is quite consistent with observations made in Falling Objects that all objects fall
at the same rate if friction is negligible. Second, only the speed of the roller coaster is considered; there is no
information about its direction at any point. This reveals another general truth. When friction is negligible, the speed
of a falling body depends only on its initial speed and height, and not on its mass or the path taken. For example, the
roller coaster will have the same final speed whether it falls 20.0 m straight down or takes a more complicated path
like the one in the figure. Third, and perhaps unexpectedly, the final speed in part (b) is greater than in part (a), but
by far less than 5.00 m/s. Finally, note that speed can be found at any height along the way by simply using the
appropriate value of at the point of interest.


We have seen that work done by or against the gravitational force depends only on the starting and ending points,
and not on the path between, allowing us to define the simplifying concept of gravitational potential energy. We can
do the same thing for a few other forces, and we will see that this leads to a formal definition of the law of
conservation of energy.


 Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Converting Potential to Kinetic
 Energy
 One can study the conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy in this experiment. On a
 smooth, level surface, use a ruler of the kind that has a groove running along its length and a book to make an
 incline (see Figure 7.9). Place a marble at the 10-cm position on the ruler and let it roll down the ruler. When it
 hits the level surface, measure the time it takes to roll one meter. Now place the marble at the 20-cm and the
 30-cm positions and again measure the times it takes to roll 1 m on the level surface. Find the velocity of the
 marble on the level surface for all three positions. Plot velocity squared versus the distance traveled by the
 marble. What is the shape of each plot? If the shape is a straight line, the plot shows that the marble’s kinetic
 energy at the bottom is proportional to its potential energy at the release point.

      7.4 Conservative Forces and Potential Energy
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define conservative force, potential energy, and mechanical energy.
       • Explain the potential energy of a spring in terms of its compression when Hooke’s law applies.
       • Use the work-energy theorem to show how having only conservative forces implies conservation of
          mechanical energy.

      Potential Energy and Conservative Forces
      Work is done by a force, and some forces, such as weight, have special characteristics. A conservative force is one,
      like the gravitational force, for which work done by or against it depends only on the starting and ending points of a
      motion and not on the path taken. We can define a potential energy           for any conservative force, just as we did
      for the gravitational force. For example, when you wind up a toy, an egg timer, or an old-fashioned watch, you do
      work against its spring and store energy in it. (We treat these springs as ideal, in that we assume there is no friction
      and no production of thermal energy.) This stored energy is recoverable as work, and it is useful to think of it as
      potential energy contained in the spring. Indeed, the reason that the spring has this characteristic is that its force is
      conservative. That is, a conservative force results in stored or potential energy. Gravitational potential energy is one
      example, as is the energy stored in a spring. We will also see how conservative forces are related to the conservation
      of energy.


        Potential Energy and Conservative Forces
        Potential energy is the energy a system has due to position, shape, or configuration. It is stored energy that is
        completely recoverable.

        A conservative force is one for which work done by or against it depends only on the starting and ending points
        of a motion and not on the path taken.

        We can define a potential energy      for any conservative force. The work done against a conservative force to
        reach a final configuration depends on the configuration, not the path followed, and is the potential energy
        added.


      Potential Energy of a Spring
      First, let us obtain an expression for the potential energy stored in a spring (   ). We calculate the work done to
      stretch or compress a spring that obeys Hooke’s law. (Hooke’s law was examined in Elasticity: Stress and Strain, and
      states that the magnitude of force on the spring and the resulting deformation           are proportional,          .)
      (See Figure 7.10.) For our spring, we will replace      (the amount of deformation produced by a force ) by the
      distance that the spring is stretched or compressed along its length. So the force needed to stretch the spring has
      magnitude            , where is the spring’s force constant. The force increases linearly from 0 at the start to  in
      the fully stretched position. The average force is      . Thus the work done in stretching or compressing the spring is
                                    . Alternatively, we noted in Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem that the area
      under a graph of     vs.   is the work done by the force. In Figure 7.10(c) we see that this area is also     . We
      therefore define the potential energy of a spring,        , to be

                                                                                                                        7.42

      where is the spring’s force constant and is the displacement from its undeformed position. The potential energy
      represents the work done on the spring and the energy stored in it as a result of stretching or compressing it a
      distance . The potential energy of the spring    does not depend on the path taken; it depends only on the
      stretch or squeeze in the final configuration.

FIGURE 7.10 (a) An undeformed spring has no        stored in it. (b) The force needed to stretch (or compress) the spring a distance has a
magnitude         , and the work done to stretch (or compress) it is         . Because the force is conservative, this work is stored as
potential energy      in the spring, and it can be fully recovered. (c) A graph of   vs.   has a slope of , and the area under the graph is
     . Thus the work done or potential energy stored is         .

The equation                      has general validity beyond the special case for which it was derived. Potential energy
can be stored in any elastic medium by deforming it. Indeed, the general definition of potential energy is energy
due to position, shape, or configuration. For shape or position deformations, stored energy is              , where
is the force constant of the particular system and             is its deformation. Another example is seen in Figure 7.11 for a
guitar string.




FIGURE 7.11 Work is done to deform the guitar string, giving it potential energy. When released, the potential energy is converted to kinetic
energy and back to potential as the string oscillates back and forth. A very small fraction is dissipated as sound energy, slowly removing
energy from the string.

Conservation of Mechanical Energy
Let us now consider what form the work-energy theorem takes when only conservative forces are involved. This will
lead us to the conservation of energy principle. The work-energy theorem states that the net work done by all forces
acting on a system equals its change in kinetic energy. In equation form, this is

                                                                                                                                       7.43

If only conservative forces act, then
                                                                                                                                       7.44

      where        is the total work done by all conservative forces. Thus,
                                                                                                                                               7.45
      Now, if the conservative force, such as the gravitational force or a spring force, does work, the system loses
      potential energy. That is,              . Therefore,
                                                                                                                                               7.46
      or
                                                                                                                                               7.47
      This equation means that the total kinetic and potential energy is constant for any process involving only
      conservative forces. That is,


                                                                                                                                               7.48


      where i and f denote initial and final values. This equation is a form of the work-energy theorem for conservative
      forces; it is known as the conservation of mechanical energy principle. Remember that this applies to the extent
      that all the forces are conservative, so that friction is negligible. The total kinetic plus potential energy of a system is
      defined to be its mechanical energy,                 . In a system that experiences only conservative forces, there is a
      potential energy associated with each force, and the energy only changes form between               and the various types of
         , with the total energy remaining constant.


              EXAMPLE 7.8

      Using Conservation of Mechanical Energy to Calculate the Speed of a Toy Car
      A 0.100-kg toy car is propelled by a compressed spring, as shown in Figure 7.12. The car follows a track that rises
      0.180 m above the starting point. The spring is compressed 4.00 cm and has a force constant of 250.0 N/m.
      Assuming work done by friction to be negligible, find (a) how fast the car is going before it starts up the slope and (b)
      how fast it is going at the top of the slope.




      FIGURE 7.12 A toy car is pushed by a compressed spring and coasts up a slope. Assuming negligible friction, the potential energy in the
      spring is first completely converted to kinetic energy, and then to a combination of kinetic and gravitational potential energy as the car rises.
      The details of the path are unimportant because all forces are conservative—the car would have the same final speed if it took the alternate
      path shown.

      Strategy

      The spring force and the gravitational force are conservative forces, so conservation of mechanical energy can be
      used. Thus,
                                                                                                                                               7.49
      or

                                                                                                                                               7.50

      where is the height (vertical position) and is the compression of the spring. This general statement looks
      complex but becomes much simpler when we start considering specific situations. First, we must identify the initial

and final conditions in a problem; then, we enter them into the last equation to solve for an unknown.

Solution for (a)

This part of the problem is limited to conditions just before the car is released and just after it leaves the spring.
Take the initial height to be zero, so that both and       are zero. Furthermore, the initial speed is zero and the
final compression of the spring      is zero, and so several terms in the conservation of mechanical energy equation
are zero and it simplifies to

                                                                                                                    7.51

In other words, the initial potential energy in the spring is converted completely to kinetic energy in the absence of
friction. Solving for the final speed and entering known values yields



                                                                                                                    7.52



Solution for (b)

One method of finding the speed at the top of the slope is to consider conditions just before the car is released and
just after it reaches the top of the slope, completely ignoring everything in between. Doing the same type of analysis
to find which terms are zero, the conservation of mechanical energy becomes

                                                                                                                    7.53

This form of the equation means that the spring’s initial potential energy is converted partly to gravitational potential
energy and partly to kinetic energy. The final speed at the top of the slope will be less than at the bottom. Solving for
   and substituting known values gives




                                                                                                                    7.54




Discussion

Another way to solve this problem is to realize that the car’s kinetic energy before it goes up the slope is converted
partly to potential energy—that is, to take the final conditions in part (a) to be the initial conditions in part (b).


Note that, for conservative forces, we do not directly calculate the work they do; rather, we consider their effects
through their corresponding potential energies, just as we did in Example 7.8. Note also that we do not consider
details of the path taken—only the starting and ending points are important (as long as the path is not impossible).
This assumption is usually a tremendous simplification, because the path may be complicated and forces may vary
along the way.

      7.5 Nonconservative Forces
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define nonconservative forces and explain how they affect mechanical energy.
       • Show how the principle of conservation of energy can be applied by treating the conservative forces in
          terms of their potential energies and any nonconservative forces in terms of the work they do.

      Nonconservative Forces and Friction
      Forces are either conservative or nonconservative. Conservative forces were discussed in Conservative Forces and
      Potential Energy. A nonconservative force is one for which work depends on the path taken. Friction is a good
      example of a nonconservative force. As illustrated in Figure 7.13, work done against friction depends on the length
      of the path between the starting and ending points. Because of this dependence on path, there is no potential
      energy associated with nonconservative forces. An important characteristic is that the work done by a
      nonconservative force adds or removes mechanical energy from a system. Friction, for example, creates thermal
      energy that dissipates, removing energy from the system. Furthermore, even if the thermal energy is retained or
      captured, it cannot be fully converted back to work, so it is lost or not recoverable in that sense as well.




      FIGURE 7.13 The amount of the happy face erased depends on the path taken by the eraser between points A and B, as does the work
      done against friction. Less work is done and less of the face is erased for the path in (a) than for the path in (b). The force here is friction,
      and most of the work goes into thermal energy that subsequently leaves the system (the happy face plus the eraser). The energy expended
      cannot be fully recovered.

      How Nonconservative Forces Affect Mechanical Energy
      Mechanical energy may not be conserved when nonconservative forces act. For example, when a car is brought to a
      stop by friction on level ground, it loses kinetic energy, which is dissipated as thermal energy, reducing its
      mechanical energy. Figure 7.14 compares the effects of conservative and nonconservative forces. We often choose
      to understand simpler systems such as that described in Figure 7.14(a) first before studying more complicated
      systems as in Figure 7.14(b).

FIGURE 7.14 Comparison of the effects of conservative and nonconservative forces on the mechanical energy of a system. (a) A system
with only conservative forces. When a rock is dropped onto a spring, its mechanical energy remains constant (neglecting air resistance)
because the force in the spring is conservative. The spring can propel the rock back to its original height, where it once again has only
potential energy due to gravity. (b) A system with nonconservative forces. When the same rock is dropped onto the ground, it is stopped by
nonconservative forces that dissipate its mechanical energy as thermal energy, sound, and surface distortion. The rock has lost mechanical
energy.

How the Work-Energy Theorem Applies
Now let us consider what form the work-energy theorem takes when both conservative and nonconservative forces
act. We will see that the work done by nonconservative forces equals the change in the mechanical energy of a
system. As noted in Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem, the work-energy theorem states that the net
work on a system equals the change in its kinetic energy, or             . The net work is the sum of the work by
nonconservative forces plus the work by conservative forces. That is,
                                                                                                                                   7.55
so that
                                                                                                                                   7.56
where         is the total work done by all nonconservative forces and                is the total work done by all conservative
forces.




FIGURE 7.15 A person pushes a crate up a ramp, doing work on the crate. Friction and gravitational force (not shown) also do work on the
crate; both forces oppose the person’s push. As the crate is pushed up the ramp, it gains mechanical energy, implying that the work done by
the person is greater than the work done by friction.

Consider Figure 7.15, in which a person pushes a crate up a ramp and is opposed by friction. As in the previous
section, we note that work done by a conservative force comes from a loss of gravitational potential energy, so that
             . Substituting this equation into the previous one and solving for    gives
                                                                                                                                   7.57
This equation means that the total mechanical energy                 changes by exactly the amount of work done by
nonconservative forces. In Figure 7.15, this is the work done by the person minus the work done by friction. So even
if energy is not conserved for the system of interest (such as the crate), we know that an equal amount of work was
done to cause the change in total mechanical energy.
290   7 • Work, Energy, and Energy Resources



      We rearrange                              to obtain
                                                                                                                                           7.58
      This means that the amount of work done by nonconservative forces adds to the mechanical energy of a system. If
            is positive, then mechanical energy is increased, such as when the person pushes the crate up the ramp in
      Figure 7.15. If       is negative, then mechanical energy is decreased, such as when the rock hits the ground in
      Figure 7.14(b). If       is zero, then mechanical energy is conserved, and nonconservative forces are balanced. For
      example, when you push a lawn mower at constant speed on level ground, your work done is removed by the work
      of friction, and the mower has a constant energy.

      Applying Energy Conservation with Nonconservative Forces
      When no change in potential energy occurs, applying                                       amounts to applying the
      work-energy theorem by setting the change in kinetic energy to be equal to the net work done on the system, which
      in the most general case includes both conservative and nonconservative forces. But when seeking instead to find a
      change in total mechanical energy in situations that involve changes in both potential and kinetic energy, the
      previous equation                                     says that you can start by finding the change in mechanical
      energy that would have resulted from just the conservative forces, including the potential energy changes, and add
      to it the work done, with the proper sign, by any nonconservative forces involved.


              EXAMPLE 7.9

      Calculating Distance Traveled: How Far a Baseball Player Slides
      Consider the situation shown in Figure 7.16, where a baseball player slides to a stop on level ground. Using energy
      considerations, calculate the distance the 65.0-kg baseball player slides, given that his initial speed is 6.00 m/s and
      the force of friction against him is a constant 450 N.




      FIGURE 7.16 The baseball player slides to a stop in a distance . In the process, friction removes the player’s kinetic energy by doing an
      amount of work   equal to the initial kinetic energy.

      Strategy

      Friction stops the player by converting his kinetic energy into other forms, including thermal energy. In terms of the
      work-energy theorem, the work done by friction, which is negative, is added to the initial kinetic energy to reduce it
      to zero. The work done by friction is negative, because is in the opposite direction of the motion (that is,          ,
      and so              ). Thus             . The equation simplifies to

                                                                                                                                           7.59

Solution

Solving the previous equation for      and substituting known values yields

Discussion

The most important point of this example is that the amount of nonconservative work equals the change in
mechanical energy. For example, you must work harder to stop a truck, with its large mechanical energy, than to
stop a mosquito.



       EXAMPLE 7.10

Calculating Distance Traveled: Sliding Up an Incline
Suppose that the player from Example 7.9 is running up a hill having a        incline upward with a surface similar to
that in the baseball stadium. The player slides with the same initial speed, and the frictional force is still 450 N.
Determine how far he slides.




                               FIGURE 7.17 The same baseball player slides to a stop on a   slope.

Strategy

In this case, the work done by the nonconservative friction force on the player reduces the mechanical energy he
has from his kinetic energy at zero height, to the final mechanical energy he has by moving through distance to
reach height along the hill, with                   . This is expressed by the equation
                                                                                                                          7.62

Solution

The work done by friction is again              ; initially the potential energy is                        and the kinetic
energy is               ; the final energy contributions are              for the kinetic energy and
                             for the potential energy.

Substituting these values gives

                                                                                                                          7.63

      Discussion

      As might have been expected, the player slides a shorter distance by sliding uphill. Note that the problem could also
      have been solved in terms of the forces directly and the work energy theorem, instead of using the potential energy.
      This method would have required combining the normal force and force of gravity vectors, which no longer cancel
      each other because they point in different directions, and friction, to find the net force. You could then use the net
      force and the net work to find the distance that reduces the kinetic energy to zero. By applying conservation of
      energy and using the potential energy instead, we need only consider the gravitational potential energy          ,
      without combining and resolving force vectors. This simplifies the solution considerably.



        Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Determining Friction from the
        Stopping Distance
        This experiment involves the conversion of gravitational potential energy into thermal energy. Use the ruler,
        book, and marble from Take-Home Investigation—Converting Potential to Kinetic Energy. In addition, you will
        need a foam cup with a small hole in the side, as shown in Figure 7.18. From the 10-cm position on the ruler, let
        the marble roll into the cup positioned at the bottom of the ruler. Measure the distance the cup moves before
        stopping. What forces caused it to stop? What happened to the kinetic energy of the marble at the bottom of the
        ruler? Next, place the marble at the 20-cm and the 30-cm positions and again measure the distance the cup
        moves after the marble enters it. Plot the distance the cup moves versus the initial marble position on the ruler.
        Is this relationship linear?

        With some simple assumptions, you can use these data to find the coefficient of kinetic friction      of the cup on
        the table. The force of friction on the cup is         , where the normal force is just the weight of the cup plus
        the marble. The normal force and force of gravity do no work because they are perpendicular to the
        displacement of the cup, which moves horizontally. The work done by friction is . You will need the mass of
        the marble as well to calculate its initial kinetic energy.

        It is interesting to do the above experiment also with a steel marble (or ball bearing). Releasing it from the same
        positions on the ruler as you did with the glass marble, is the velocity of this steel marble the same as the
        velocity of the marble at the bottom of the ruler? Is the distance the cup moves proportional to the mass of the
        steel and glass marbles?

7.6 Conservation of Energy
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Explain the law of the conservation of energy.
 • Describe some of the many forms of energy.
 • Define efficiency of an energy conversion process as the fraction left as useful energy or work, rather than
    being transformed, for example, into thermal energy.

Law of Conservation of Energy
Energy, as we have noted, is conserved, making it one of the most important physical quantities in nature. The law
of conservation of energy can be stated as follows:

Total energy is constant in any process. It may change in form or be transferred from one system to another, but the
total remains the same.

We have explored some forms of energy and some ways it can be transferred from one system to another. This
exploration led to the definition of two major types of energy—mechanical energy              and energy transferred
via work done by nonconservative forces          . But energy takes many other forms, manifesting itself in many
different ways, and we need to be able to deal with all of these before we can write an equation for the above
general statement of the conservation of energy.

Other Forms of Energy than Mechanical Energy
At this point, we deal with all other forms of energy by lumping them into a single group called other energy (    ).
Then we can state the conservation of energy in equation form as
                                                                                                                  7.65
All types of energy and work can be included in this very general statement of conservation of energy. Kinetic energy
is    , work done by a conservative force is represented by      , work done by nonconservative forces is    , and all
other energies are included as     . This equation applies to all previous examples; in those situations   was
constant, and so it subtracted out and was not directly considered.


 Making Connections: Usefulness of the Energy Conservation Principle
 The fact that energy is conserved and has many forms makes it very important. You will find that energy is
 discussed in many contexts, because it is involved in all processes. It will also become apparent that many
 situations are best understood in terms of energy and that problems are often most easily conceptualized and
 solved by considering energy.


When does        play a role? One example occurs when a person eats. Food is oxidized with the release of carbon
dioxide, water, and energy. Some of this chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when the person moves, to
potential energy when the person changes altitude, and to thermal energy (another form of      ).

      Some of the Many Forms of Energy
      What are some other forms of energy? You can probably name a number of forms of energy not yet discussed. Many
      of these will be covered in later chapters, but let us detail a few here. Electrical energy is a common form that is
      converted to many other forms and does work in a wide range of practical situations. Fuels, such as gasoline and
      food, carry chemical energy that can be transferred to a system through oxidation. Chemical fuel can also produce
      electrical energy, such as in batteries. Batteries can in turn produce light, which is a very pure form of energy. Most
      energy sources on Earth are in fact stored energy from the energy we receive from the Sun. We sometimes refer to
      this as radiant energy, or electromagnetic radiation, which includes visible light, infrared, and ultraviolet radiation.
      Nuclear energy comes from processes that convert measurable amounts of mass into energy. Nuclear energy is
      transformed into the energy of sunlight, into electrical energy in power plants, and into the energy of the heat
      transfer and blast in weapons. Atoms and molecules inside all objects are in random motion. This internal
      mechanical energy from the random motions is called thermal energy, because it is related to the temperature of
      the object. These and all other forms of energy can be converted into one another and can do work.

      Table 7.1 gives the amount of energy stored, used, or released from various objects and in various phenomena. The
      range of energies and the variety of types and situations is impressive.


        Problem-Solving Strategies for Energy
        You will find the following problem-solving strategies useful whenever you deal with energy. The strategies help
        in organizing and reinforcing energy concepts. In fact, they are used in the examples presented in this chapter.
        The familiar general problem-solving strategies presented earlier—involving identifying physical principles,
        knowns, and unknowns, checking units, and so on—continue to be relevant here.

        Step 1. Determine the system of interest and identify what information is given and what quantity is to be
        calculated. A sketch will help.

        Step 2. Examine all the forces involved and determine whether you know or are given the potential energy from
        the work done by the forces. Then use step 3 or step 4.

        Step 3. If you know the potential energies for the forces that enter into the problem, then forces are all
        conservative, and you can apply conservation of mechanical energy simply in terms of potential and kinetic
        energy. The equation expressing conservation of energy is
                                                                                                                      7.66
        Step 4. If you know the potential energy for only some of the forces, possibly because some of them are
        nonconservative and do not have a potential energy, or if there are other energies that are not easily treated in
        terms of force and work, then the conservation of energy law in its most general form must be used.
                                                                                                                      7.67
        In most problems, one or more of the terms is zero, simplifying its solution. Do not calculate     , the work done
        by conservative forces; it is already incorporated in the  terms.

        Step 5. You have already identified the types of work and energy involved (in step 2). Before solving for the
        unknown, eliminate terms wherever possible to simplify the algebra. For example, choose            at either the
        initial or final point, so that  is zero there. Then solve for the unknown in the customary manner.

        Step 6. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable. Once you have solved a problem, reexamine the forms of
        work and energy to see if you have set up the conservation of energy equation correctly. For example, work done
        against friction should be negative, potential energy at the bottom of a hill should be less than that at the top,
        and so on. Also check to see that the numerical value obtained is reasonable. For example, the final speed of a
        skateboarder who coasts down a 3-m-high ramp could reasonably be 20 km/h, but not 80 km/h.


      Transformation of Energy
      The transformation of energy from one form into others is happening all the time. The chemical energy in food is

converted into thermal energy through metabolism; light energy is converted into chemical energy through
photosynthesis. In a larger example, the chemical energy contained in coal is converted into thermal energy as it
burns to turn water into steam in a boiler. This thermal energy in the steam in turn is converted to mechanical energy
as it spins a turbine, which is connected to a generator to produce electrical energy. (In all of these examples, not all
of the initial energy is converted into the forms mentioned. This important point is discussed later in this section.)

Another example of energy conversion occurs in a solar cell. Sunlight impinging on a solar cell (see Figure 7.19)
produces electricity, which in turn can be used to run an electric motor. Energy is converted from the primary source
of solar energy into electrical energy and then into mechanical energy.

7.7 Power
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Calculate power by calculating changes in energy over time.
 • Examine power consumption and calculations of the cost of energy consumed.

What is Power?
Power—the word conjures up many images: a professional football player muscling aside his opponent, a dragster
roaring away from the starting line, a volcano blowing its lava into the atmosphere, or a rocket blasting off, as in
Figure 7.20.
298   7 • Work, Energy, and Energy Resources




         FIGURE 7.20 This powerful rocket on the Space Shuttle Endeavor did work and consumed energy at a very high rate. (credit: NASA)

      These images of power have in common the rapid performance of work, consistent with the scientific definition of
      power ( ) as the rate at which work is done.


        Power
        Power is the rate at which work is done.

                                                                                                                                  7.69

        The SI unit for power is the watt (      ), where 1 watt equals 1 joule/second


      Because work is energy transfer, power is also the rate at which energy is expended. A 60-W light bulb, for example,
      expends 60 J of energy per second. Great power means a large amount of work or energy developed in a short time.
      For example, when a powerful car accelerates rapidly, it does a large amount of work and consumes a large amount
      of fuel in a short time.

      Calculating Power from Energy

              EXAMPLE 7.11

      Calculating the Power to Climb Stairs
      What is the power output for a 60.0-kg woman who runs up a 3.00 m high flight of stairs in 3.50 s, starting from rest
      but having a final speed of 2.00 m/s? (See Figure 7.21.)

FIGURE 7.21 When this woman runs upstairs starting from rest, she converts the chemical energy originally from food into kinetic energy
and gravitational potential energy. Her power output depends on how fast she does this.

Strategy and Concept

The work going into mechanical energy is                          . At the bottom of the stairs, we take both            and        as
initially zero; thus,                                           , where     is the vertical height of the stairs. Because all terms
are given, we can calculate         and then divide it by time to get power.

Solution

Substituting the expression for          into the definition of power given in the previous equation,                     yields

                                                                                                                                   7.70

Entering known values yields



                                                                                                                                   7.71



Discussion

The woman does 1764 J of work to move up the stairs compared with only 120 J to increase her kinetic energy;
thus, most of her power output is required for climbing rather than accelerating.


It is impressive that this woman’s useful power output is slightly less than 1 horsepower                ! People
can generate more than a horsepower with their leg muscles for short periods of time by rapidly converting available
blood sugar and oxygen into work output. (A horse can put out 1 hp for hours on end.) Once oxygen is depleted,
power output decreases and the person begins to breathe rapidly to obtain oxygen to metabolize more food—this is
known as the aerobic stage of exercise. If the woman climbed the stairs slowly, then her power output would be
much less, although the amount of work done would be the same.


  Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Measure Your Power Rating
  Determine your own power rating by measuring the time it takes you to climb a flight of stairs. We will ignore the
  gain in kinetic energy, as the above example showed that it was a small portion of the energy gain. Don’t expect
300   7 • Work, Energy, and Energy Resources



        that your output will be more than about 0.5 hp.


      Examples of Power
      Examples of power are limited only by the imagination, because there are as many types as there are forms of work
      and energy. (See Table 7.3 for some examples.) Sunlight reaching Earth’s surface carries a maximum power of about
      1.3 kilowatts per square meter              A tiny fraction of this is retained by Earth over the long term. Our
      consumption rate of fossil fuels is far greater than the rate at which they are stored, so it is inevitable that they will
      be depleted. Power implies that energy is transferred, perhaps changing form. It is never possible to change one
      form completely into another without losing some of it as thermal energy. For example, a 60-W incandescent bulb
      converts only 5 W of electrical power to light, with 55 W dissipating into thermal energy. Furthermore, the typical
      electric power plant converts only 35 to 40% of its fuel into electricity. The remainder becomes a huge amount of
      thermal energy that must be dispersed as heat transfer, as rapidly as it is created. A coal-fired power plant may
      produce 1000 megawatts; 1 megawatt (MW) is                of electric power. But the power plant consumes chemical
      energy at a rate of about 2500 MW, creating heat transfer to the surroundings at a rate of 1500 MW. (See Figure
      7.22.)




      FIGURE 7.22 Tremendous amounts of electric power are generated by coal-fired power plants such as this one in China, but an even larger
      amount of power goes into heat transfer to the surroundings. The large cooling towers here are needed to transfer heat as rapidly as it is
      produced. The transfer of heat is not unique to coal plants but is an unavoidable consequence of generating electric power from any
      fuel—nuclear, coal, oil, natural gas, or the like. (credit: Kleinolive, Wikimedia Commons)

                TABLE 7.3 Power Output or Consumption

Power and Energy Consumption
We usually have to pay for the energy we use. It is interesting and easy to estimate the cost of energy for an
electrical appliance if its power consumption rate and time used are known. The higher the power consumption rate
and the longer the appliance is used, the greater the cost of that appliance. The power consumption rate is
                 , where is the energy supplied by the electricity company. So the energy consumed over a time is
                                                                                                                7.72
Electricity bills state the energy used in units of kilowatt-hours       which is the product of power in kilowatts
and time in hours. This unit is convenient because electrical power consumption at the kilowatt level for hours at a
time is typical.


       EXAMPLE 7.12

Calculating Energy Costs
What is the cost of running a 0.200-kW computer 6.00 h per day for 30.0 d if the cost of electricity is $0.120 per
       ?

Strategy

Cost is based on energy consumed; thus, we must find from             and then calculate the cost. Because
electrical energy is expressed in    , at the start of a problem such as this it is convenient to convert the units
into     and hours.
302   7 • Work, Energy, and Energy Resources



      Solution

      The energy consumed in            is

                                                                                                                      7.73

      and the cost is simply given by

                                                                                                                      7.74

      Discussion

      The cost of using the computer in this example is neither exorbitant nor negligible. It is clear that the cost is a
      combination of power and time. When both are high, such as for an air conditioner in the summer, the cost is high.


      The motivation to save energy has become more compelling with its ever-increasing price. Armed with the
      knowledge that energy consumed is the product of power and time, you can estimate costs for yourself and make
      the necessary value judgments about where to save energy. Either power or time must be reduced. It is most cost-
      effective to limit the use of high-power devices that normally operate for long periods of time, such as water heaters
      and air conditioners. This would not include relatively high power devices like toasters, because they are on only a
      few minutes per day. It would also not include electric clocks, in spite of their 24-hour-per-day usage, because they
      are very low power devices. It is sometimes possible to use devices that have greater efficiencies—that is, devices
      that consume less power to accomplish the same task. One example is the compact fluorescent light bulb, which
      produces over four times more light per watt of power consumed than its incandescent cousin.

      Modern civilization depends on energy, but current levels of energy consumption and production are not
      sustainable. The likelihood of a link between global warming and fossil fuel use (with its concomitant production of
      carbon dioxide), has made reduction in energy use as well as a shift to non-fossil fuels of the utmost importance.
      Even though energy in an isolated system is a conserved quantity, the final result of most energy transformations is
      waste heat transfer to the environment, which is no longer useful for doing work. As we will discuss in more detail in
      Thermodynamics, the potential for energy to produce useful work has been “degraded” in the energy
      transformation.

      7.8 Work, Energy, and Power in Humans
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Explain the human body’s consumption of energy when at rest vs. when engaged in activities that do
          useful work.
       • Calculate the conversion of chemical energy in food into useful work.

      Energy Conversion in Humans
      Our own bodies, like all living organisms, are energy conversion machines. Conservation of energy implies that the
      chemical energy stored in food is converted into work, thermal energy, and/or stored as chemical energy in fatty
      tissue. (See Figure 7.23.) The fraction going into each form depends both on how much we eat and on our level of
      physical activity. If we eat more than is needed to do work and stay warm, the remainder goes into body fat.

FIGURE 7.23 Energy consumed by humans is converted to work, thermal energy, and stored fat. By far the largest fraction goes to thermal
energy, although the fraction varies depending on the type of physical activity.

Power Consumed at Rest
The rate at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do different activities is called the metabolic rate.
The total energy conversion rate of a person at rest is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and is divided among
various systems in the body, as shown in Table 7.4. The largest fraction goes to the liver and spleen, with the brain
coming next. Of course, during vigorous exercise, the energy consumption of the skeletal muscles and heart
increase markedly. About 75% of the calories burned in a day go into these basic functions. The BMR is a function of
age, gender, total body weight, and amount of muscle mass (which burns more calories than body fat). Athletes
have a greater BMR due to this last factor.

    TABLE 7.4 Basal Metabolic Rates (BMR)

Energy consumption is directly proportional to oxygen consumption because the digestive process is basically one
of oxidizing food. We can measure the energy people use during various activities by measuring their oxygen use.
(See Figure 7.24.) Approximately 20 kJ of energy are produced for each liter of oxygen consumed, independent of
the type of food. Table 7.5 shows energy and oxygen consumption rates (power expended) for a variety of activities.

Power of Doing Useful Work
Work done by a person is sometimes called useful work, which is work done on the outside world, such as lifting
weights. Useful work requires a force exerted through a distance on the outside world, and so it excludes internal
work, such as that done by the heart when pumping blood. Useful work does include that done in climbing stairs or
accelerating to a full run, because these are accomplished by exerting forces on the outside world. Forces exerted
by the body are nonconservative, so that they can change the mechanical energy (              ) of the system worked
upon, and this is often the goal. A baseball player throwing a ball, for example, increases both the ball’s kinetic and
potential energy.
304   7 • Work, Energy, and Energy Resources



      If a person needs more energy than they consume, such as when doing vigorous work, the body must draw upon the
      chemical energy stored in fat. So exercise can be helpful in losing fat. However, the amount of exercise needed to
      produce a loss in fat, or to burn off extra calories consumed that day, can be large, as Example 7.13 illustrates.


              EXAMPLE 7.13

      Calculating Weight Loss from Exercising
      If a person who normally requires an average of 12,000 kJ (3000 kcal) of food energy per day consumes 13,000 kJ
      per day, they will steadily add body fat. How much bicycling per day is required to work off this extra 1000 kJ?

      Solution

      Table 7.5 states that 400 W are used when cycling at a moderate speed. The time required to work off 1000 kJ at
      this rate is then

                                                                                                                                       7.75


      Discussion

      If this person uses more energy than they consume, the person’s body will obtain the needed energy by
      metabolizing body fat. If the person uses 13,000 kJ but consumes only 12,000 kJ, then the amount of fat loss will
      be

                                                                                                                                       7.76

      assuming the energy content of fat to be 39 kJ/g.

      TABLE 7.5 Energy and Oxygen Consumption Rates (Power)

All bodily functions, from thinking to lifting weights, require energy. (See Figure 7.25.) The many small muscle
actions accompanying all quiet activity, from sleeping to head scratching, ultimately become thermal energy, as do
less visible muscle actions by the heart, lungs, and digestive tract. Shivering, in fact, is an involuntary response to
low body temperature that pits muscles against one another to produce thermal energy in the body (and do no
work). The kidneys and liver consume a surprising amount of energy, but the biggest surprise of all is that a full 25%
of all energy consumed by the body is used to maintain electrical potentials in all living cells. (Nerve cells use this
electrical potential in nerve impulses.) This bioelectrical energy ultimately becomes mostly thermal energy, but
some is utilized to power chemical processes such as in the kidneys and liver, and in fat production.

      7.9 World Energy Use
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Describe the distinction between renewable and nonrenewable energy sources.
       • Explain why the inevitable conversion of energy to less useful forms makes it necessary to conserve
          energy resources.

      Energy is an important ingredient in all phases of society. We live in a very interdependent world, and access to
      adequate and reliable energy resources is crucial for economic growth and for maintaining the quality of our lives.
      But current levels of energy consumption and production are not sustainable. Depending on the data source,
      estimates indicate that about 31–35% of the world’s energy comes from oil, and much of that goes to transportation
      uses. This is a reduction by a few percentage points from ten years ago. Oil prices are dependent as much upon new
      (or foreseen) discoveries as they are upon political events and situations around the world. The U.S., with 4.25% of
      the world’s population, consumes 21% of the world’s oil production per year.

      Renewable and Nonrenewable Energy Sources
      The principal energy resources used in the world are shown in Figure 7.26. The fuel mix has changed over the years
      but now is dominated by oil, although natural gas and solar contributions are increasing. Renewable forms of
      energy are those sources that cannot be used up, such as water, wind, solar, and biomass. About 85% of our energy
      comes from nonrenewable fossil fuels—oil, natural gas, coal. The likelihood of a link between global warming and
      fossil fuel use, with its production of carbon dioxide through combustion, has made, in the eyes of many scientists, a
      shift to non-fossil fuels of utmost importance—but it will not be easy.

      The World’s Growing Energy Needs
      World energy consumption continues to rise, especially in the developing countries. (See Figure 7.27.) Global
      demand for energy has tripled in the past 50 years and might triple again in the next 30 years. While much of this
      growth will come from the rapidly booming economies of China and India, many of the developed countries,
      especially those in Europe, are hoping to meet their energy needs by expanding the use of renewable sources.
      Although presently only a small percentage, renewable energy is growing very fast, especially wind energy. For
      example, Germany plans to meet 65% of its power and 30% of its overall energy needs with renewable resources by
      the year 2030. (See Figure 7.28.) Energy is a key constraint in the rapid economic growth of China and India. In
      2003, China surpassed Japan as the world’s second largest consumer of oil. However, over 1/3 of this is imported.
      Unlike most Western countries, coal dominates the commercial energy resources of China, accounting for 2/3 of its
      energy consumption. In 2009 China surpassed the United States as the largest generator of         . In India, the main
      energy resources are biomass (wood and dung) and coal. Half of India’s oil is imported. About 70% of India’s

electricity is generated by highly polluting coal. Yet there are sizeable strides being made in renewable energy. India
has a rapidly growing wind energy base, and it has the largest solar cooking program in the world. China has
invested substantially in building solar collection farms as well as hydroelectric plants.

Table 7.6 displays the 2020 commercial energy mix by country for some of the prime energy users in the world.
While non-renewable sources dominate, some countries get a sizeable percentage of their electricity from
renewable resources. For example, about two-thirds of New Zealand’s electricity demand is met by hydroelectric.
Only 10% of the U.S. electricity is generated by renewable resources, primarily hydroelectric. It is difficult to
determine total sources and consumers of energy in many countries, and estimates vary somewhat by data source
and type of measurement.

      TABLE 7.6 Energy Consumption—Selected Countries (2020)

      Energy and Economic Well-being
      Economic well-being is dependent upon energy use, and in most countries higher standards of living, as measured
      by GDP (gross domestic product) per capita, are matched by higher levels of energy consumption per capita. This is
      borne out in Figure 7.29. Increased efficiency of energy use will change this dependency. A global problem is
      balancing energy resource development against the harmful effects upon the environment in its extraction and use.

      New and diversified energy sources do, however, greatly increase economic opportunity and stability. First, the
      extensive employment opportunities in renewable energy make it one of the most sustainable and secure fields to
      enter. Second, renewable energy provides countries and localities with increased levels of resiliency in the face of
      natural disasters, conflict, or other disruptions. The 21st century has already seen major economic impacts from
      energy disruptions: Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, various wildfires, Hurricane Maria, and the 2021 Texas
      Winter Storm demonstrate the vulnerability of United States power systems. Diversifying energy sources through
      renewables and other fossil-fuel alternatives brings power grids and transportation systems back online much more
      quickly, saving lives and enabling a more swift return to economic operations. And as critical emerging information
      infrastructure, such as data centers, requires more of the world's energy, supplying those growing systems during
      normal operations and crises will be increasingly important.

Conserving Energy
As we finish this chapter on energy and work, it is relevant to draw some distinctions between two sometimes
misunderstood terms in the area of energy use. As has been mentioned elsewhere, the “law of the conservation of
energy” is a very useful principle in analyzing physical processes. It is a statement that cannot be proven from basic
principles, but is a very good bookkeeping device, and no exceptions have ever been found. It states that the total
amount of energy in an isolated system will always remain constant. Related to this principle, but remarkably
different from it, is the important philosophy of energy conservation. This concept has to do with seeking to
decrease the amount of energy used by an individual or group through (1) reduced activities (e.g., turning down
thermostats, driving fewer kilometers) and/or (2) increasing conversion efficiencies in the performance of a
particular task—such as developing and using more efficient room heaters, cars that have greater miles-per-gallon
ratings, energy-efficient compact fluorescent lights, etc.

Since energy in an isolated system is not destroyed or created or generated, one might wonder why we need to be
concerned about our energy resources, since energy is a conserved quantity. The problem is that the final result of
most energy transformations is waste heat transfer to the environment and conversion to energy forms no longer
useful for doing work. To state it in another way, the potential for energy to produce useful work has been
“degraded” in the energy transformation. (This will be discussed in more detail in Thermodynamics.)

INTRODUCTION TO LINEAR MOMENTUM AND COLLISIONS We use the term momentum in various ways in
everyday language, and most of these ways are consistent with its precise scientific definition. We speak of sports
teams or politicians gaining and maintaining the momentum to win. We also recognize that momentum has
something to do with collisions. For example, looking at the rugby players in the photograph colliding and falling to
the ground, we expect their momenta to have great effects in the resulting collisions. Generally, momentum implies
a tendency to continue on course—to move in the same direction—and is associated with great mass and speed.

Momentum, like energy, is important because it is conserved. Only a few physical quantities are conserved in nature,
324   8 • Linear Momentum and Collisions



      and studying them yields fundamental insight into how nature works, as we shall see in our study of momentum.

      8.1 Linear Momentum and Force
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define linear momentum.
       • Explain the relationship between momentum and force.
       • State Newton’s second law of motion in terms of momentum.
       • Calculate momentum given mass and velocity.

      Linear Momentum
      The scientific definition of linear momentum is consistent with most people’s intuitive understanding of momentum:
      a large, fast-moving object has greater momentum than a smaller, slower object. Linear momentum is defined as
      the product of a system’s mass multiplied by its velocity. In symbols, linear momentum is expressed as
                                                                                                                     8.1
      Momentum is directly proportional to the object’s mass and also its velocity. Thus the greater an object’s mass or
      the greater its velocity, the greater its momentum. Momentum is a vector having the same direction as the velocity
       . The SI unit for momentum is             .

        Linear momentum is defined as the product of a system’s mass multiplied by its velocity:

              EXAMPLE 8.1

      Calculating Momentum: A Football Player and a Football
      (a) Calculate the momentum of a 110-kg football player running at 8.00 m/s. (b) Compare the player’s momentum
      with the momentum of a hard-thrown 0.410-kg football that has a speed of 25.0 m/s.

      Strategy

      No information is given regarding direction, and so we can calculate only the magnitude of the momentum, . (As
      usual, a symbol that is in italics is a magnitude, whereas one that is italicized, boldfaced, and has an arrow is a
      vector.) In both parts of this example, the magnitude of momentum can be calculated directly from the definition of
      momentum given in the equation, which becomes
                                                                                                                     8.3
      when only magnitudes are considered.

      Solution for (a)

      To determine the momentum of the player, substitute the known values for the player’s mass and speed into the
      equation.

                                                                                                                     8.4

      Solution for (b)

      To determine the momentum of the ball, substitute the known values for the ball’s mass and speed into the
      equation.

                                                                                                                     8.5

The ratio of the player’s momentum to that of the ball is

                                                                                                                8.6

Discussion

Although the ball has greater velocity, the player has a much greater mass. Thus the momentum of the player is
much greater than the momentum of the football, as you might guess. As a result, the player’s motion is only slightly
affected if he catches the ball. We shall quantify what happens in such collisions in terms of momentum in later
sections.


Momentum and Newton’s Second Law
The importance of momentum, unlike the importance of energy, was recognized early in the development of
classical physics. Momentum was deemed so important that it was called the “quantity of motion.” Newton actually
stated his second law of motion in terms of momentum: The net external force equals the change in momentum of
a system divided by the time over which it changes. Using symbols, this law is

                                                                                                                8.7

where        is the net external force,   is the change in momentum, and     is the change in time.


 Newton’s Second Law of Motion in Terms of Momentum
 The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes.

                                                                                                              8.8




 Making Connections: Force and Momentum
 Force and momentum are intimately related. Force acting over time can change momentum, and Newton’s
 second law of motion, can be stated in its most broadly applicable form in terms of momentum. Momentum
 continues to be a key concept in the study of atomic and subatomic particles in quantum mechanics.


This statement of Newton’s second law of motion includes the more familiar             as a special case. We can
derive this form as follows. First, note that the change in momentum  is given by
                                                                                                                8.9
If the mass of the system is constant, then
                                                                                                               8.10
So that for constant mass, Newton’s second law of motion becomes

                                                                                                               8.11

Because           , we get the familiar equation

                                                                                                               8.12
when the mass of the system is constant.

Newton’s second law of motion stated in terms of momentum is more generally applicable because it can be applied
to systems where the mass is changing, such as rockets, as well as to systems of constant mass. We will consider
systems with varying mass in some detail; however, the relationship between momentum and force remains useful
326   8 • Linear Momentum and Collisions



      when mass is constant, such as in the following example.


              EXAMPLE 8.2

      Calculating Force: Venus Williams’ Racquet
      During the 2007 French Open, Venus Williams hit the fastest recorded serve in a premier women’s match, reaching a
      speed of 58 m/s (209 km/h). What is the average force exerted on the 0.057-kg tennis ball by Venus Williams’
      racquet, assuming that the ball’s speed just after impact is 58 m/s, that the initial horizontal component of the
      velocity before impact is negligible, and that the ball remained in contact with the racquet for 5.0 ms (milliseconds)?

      Strategy

      This problem involves only one dimension because the ball starts from having no horizontal velocity component
      before impact. Newton’s second law stated in terms of momentum is then written as

                                                                                                                       8.13

      As noted above, when mass is constant, the change in momentum is given by
                                                                                                                       8.14
      In this example, the velocity just after impact and the change in time are given; thus, once    is calculated,
                   can be used to find the force.

      Solution

      To determine the change in momentum, substitute the values for the initial and final velocities into the equation
      above.


                                                                                                                       8.15


      Now the magnitude of the net external force can determined by using                :


                                                                                                                       8.16


      where we have retained only two significant figures in the final step.

      This quantity was the average force exerted by Venus Williams’ racquet on the tennis ball during its brief impact
      (note that the ball also experienced the 0.56-N force of gravity, but that force was not due to the racquet). This
      problem could also be solved by first finding the acceleration and then using             , but one additional step
      would be required compared with the strategy used in this example.


      8.2 Impulse
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define impulse.
       • Describe effects of impulses in everyday life.
       • Determine the average effective force using graphical representation.
       • Calculate average force and impulse given mass, velocity, and time.

      The effect of a force on an object depends on how long it acts, as well as how great the force is. In Example 8.1, a
      very large force acting for a short time had a great effect on the momentum of the tennis ball. A small force could

cause the same change in momentum, but it would have to act for a much longer time. For example, if the ball were
thrown upward, the gravitational force (which is much smaller than the tennis racquet’s force) would eventually
reverse the momentum of the ball. Quantitatively, the effect we are talking about is the change in momentum     .

By rearranging the equation              to be

                                                                                                                   8.17
we can see how the change in momentum equals the average net external force multiplied by the time this force
acts. The quantity      is given the name impulse. Impulse is the same as the change in momentum.


 Impulse: Change in Momentum
 Change in momentum equals the average net external force multiplied by the time this force acts.
                                                                                                                8.18
 The quantity          is given the name impulse.

 There are many ways in which an understanding of impulse can save lives, or at least limbs. The dashboard
 padding in a car, and certainly the airbags, allow the net force on the occupants in the car to act over a much
 longer time when there is a sudden stop. The momentum change is the same for an occupant, whether an air
 bag is deployed or not, but the force (to bring the occupant to a stop) will be much less if it acts over a larger
 time. Cars today have many plastic components. One advantage of plastics is their lighter weight, which results
 in better gas mileage. Another advantage is that a car will crumple in a collision, especially in the event of a
 head-on collision. A longer collision time means the force on the car will be less. Deaths during car races
 decreased dramatically when the rigid frames of racing cars were replaced with parts that could crumple or
 collapse in the event of an accident.

 Bones in a body will fracture if the force on them is too large. If you jump onto the floor from a table, the force on
 your legs can be immense if you land stiff-legged on a hard surface. Rolling on the ground after jumping from the
 table, or landing with a parachute, extends the time over which the force (on you from the ground) acts.



       EXAMPLE 8.3

Calculating Magnitudes of Impulses: Two Billiard Balls Striking a Rigid Wall
Two identical billiard balls strike a rigid wall with the same speed, and are reflected without any change of speed.
The first ball strikes perpendicular to the wall. The second ball strikes the wall at an angle of   from the
perpendicular, and bounces off at an angle of          from perpendicular to the wall.

(a) Determine the direction of the force on the wall due to each ball.

(b) Calculate the ratio of the magnitudes of impulses on the two balls by the wall.

Strategy for (a)

In order to determine the force on the wall, consider the force on the ball due to the wall using Newton’s second law
and then apply Newton’s third law to determine the direction. Assume the -axis to be normal to the wall and to be
positive in the initial direction of motion. Choose the -axis to be along the wall in the plane of the second ball’s
motion. The momentum direction and the velocity direction are the same.

Solution for (a)

The first ball bounces directly into the wall and exerts a force on it in the direction. Therefore the wall exerts a
force on the ball in the    direction. The second ball continues with the same momentum component in the
direction, but reverses its -component of momentum, as seen by sketching a diagram of the angles involved and
keeping in mind the proportionality between velocity and momentum.
328   8 • Linear Momentum and Collisions



      These changes mean the change in momentum for both balls is in the          direction, so the force of the wall on each
      ball is along the direction.

      Strategy for (b)

      Calculate the change in momentum for each ball, which is equal to the impulse imparted to the ball.

      Solution for (b)

      Let be the speed of each ball before and after collision with the wall, and the mass of each ball. Choose the
       -axis and -axis as previously described, and consider the change in momentum of the first ball which strikes
      perpendicular to the wall.

                                                                                                                         8.19

                                                                                                                         8.20

      Impulse is the change in momentum vector. Therefore the -component of impulse is equal to                and the
       -component of impulse is equal to zero.

      Now consider the change in momentum of the second ball.

                                                                                                                         8.21

                                                                                                                         8.22

      It should be noted here that while      changes sign after the collision,   does not. Therefore the -component of
      impulse is equal to                  and the -component of impulse is equal to zero.

      The ratio of the magnitudes of the impulse imparted to the balls is

                                                                                                                         8.23


      Discussion

      The direction of impulse and force is the same as in the case of (a); it is normal to the wall and along the negative
       -direction. Making use of Newton’s third law, the force on the wall due to each ball is normal to the wall along the
      positive -direction.


      Our definition of impulse includes an assumption that the force is constant over the time interval . Forces are
      usually not constant. Forces vary considerably even during the brief time intervals considered. It is, however,
      possible to find an average effective force    that produces the same result as the corresponding time-varying
      force. Figure 8.2 shows a graph of what an actual force looks like as a function of time for a ball bouncing off the
      floor. The area under the curve has units of momentum and is equal to the impulse or change in momentum
      between times and . That area is equal to the area inside the rectangle bounded by              , , and . Thus the
      impulses and their effects are the same for both the actual and effective forces.

  Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Hand Movement and Impulse
  Try catching a ball while “giving” with the ball, pulling your hands toward your body. Then, try catching a ball
  while keeping your hands still. Hit water in a tub with your full palm. After the water has settled, hit the water
  again by diving your hand with your fingers first into the water. (Your full palm represents a swimmer doing a
  belly flop and your diving hand represents a swimmer doing a dive.) Explain what happens in each case and why.
  Which orientations would you advise people to avoid and why?



  Making Connections: Constant Force and Constant Acceleration
  The assumption of a constant force in the definition of impulse is analogous to the assumption of a constant
  acceleration in kinematics. In both cases, nature is adequately described without the use of calculus.


8.3 Conservation of Momentum
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Describe the principle of conservation of momentum.
 • Derive an expression for the conservation of momentum.
 • Explain conservation of momentum with examples.
 • Explain the principle of conservation of momentum as it relates to atomic and subatomic particles.

Momentum is an important quantity because it is conserved. Yet it was not conserved in the examples in Impulse
and Linear Momentum and Force, where large changes in momentum were produced by forces acting on the system
of interest. Under what circumstances is momentum conserved?

The answer to this question entails considering a sufficiently large system. It is always possible to find a larger
system in which total momentum is constant, even if momentum changes for components of the system. If a
football player runs into the goalpost in the end zone, there will be a force on him that causes him to bounce
backward. However, the Earth also recoils —conserving momentum—because of the force applied to it through the
goalpost. Because Earth is many orders of magnitude more massive than the player, its recoil is immeasurably small
and can be neglected in any practical sense, but it is real nevertheless.

Consider what happens if the masses of two colliding objects are more similar than the masses of a football player
and Earth—for example, one car bumping into another, as shown in Figure 8.3. Both cars are coasting in the same
direction when the lead car (labeled        is bumped by the trailing car (labeled       The only unbalanced force on
each car is the force of the collision. (Assume that the effects due to friction are negligible.) Car 1 slows down as a
result of the collision, losing some momentum, while car 2 speeds up and gains some momentum. We shall now
show that the total momentum of the two-car system remains constant.
330   8 • Linear Momentum and Collisions




      FIGURE 8.3 A car of mass        moving with a velocity of    bumps into another car of mass         and velocity    that it is following. As a
      result, the first car slows down to a velocity of    and the second speeds up to a velocity of       . The momentum of each car is changed,
      but the total momentum         of the two cars is the same before and after the collision (if you assume friction is negligible).

      Using the definition of impulse, the change in momentum of car 1 is given by
                                                                                                                                                8.24
      where      is the force on car 1 due to car 2, and    is the time the force acts (the duration of the collision).
      Intuitively, it seems obvious that the collision time is the same for both cars, but it is only true for objects traveling at
      ordinary speeds. This assumption must be modified for objects travelling near the speed of light, without affecting
      the result that momentum is conserved.

      Similarly, the change in momentum of car 2 is
                                                                                                                                                8.25
      where    is the force on car 2 due to car 1, and we assume the duration of the collision                         is the same for both cars.
      We know from Newton’s third law that              , and so
                                                                                                                                                8.26
      Thus, the changes in momentum are equal and opposite, and
                                                                                                                                                8.27
      Because the changes in momentum add to zero, the total momentum of the two-car system is constant. That is,
                                                                                                                                                8.28
                                                                                                                                                8.29
      where        and       are the momenta of cars 1 and 2 after the collision. (We often use primes to denote the final
      state.)

      This result—that momentum is conserved—has validity far beyond the preceding one-dimensional case. It can be
      similarly shown that total momentum is conserved for any isolated system, with any number of objects in it. In
      equation form, the conservation of momentum principle for an isolated system is written
                                                                                                                                                8.30

where     is the total momentum (the sum of the momenta of the individual objects in the system) and is the

the system.) An isolated system is defined to be one for which the net external force is zero


  Conservation of Momentum Principle

                                                                                                                                        8.32




  Isolated System
  An isolated system is defined to be one for which the net external force is zero


Perhaps an easier way to see that momentum is conserved for an isolated system is to consider Newton’s second
law in terms of momentum,                           . For an isolated system,                    ; thus,              , and       is constant.

We have noted that the three length dimensions in nature— , , and —are independent, and it is interesting to note
that momentum can be conserved in different ways along each dimension. For example, during projectile motion
and where air resistance is negligible, momentum is conserved in the horizontal direction because horizontal forces
are zero and momentum is unchanged. But along the vertical direction, the net vertical force is not zero and the
momentum of the projectile is not conserved. (See Figure 8.4.) However, if the momentum of the projectile-Earth
system is considered in the vertical direction, we find that the total momentum is conserved.




FIGURE 8.4 The horizontal component of a projectile’s momentum is conserved if air resistance is negligible, even in this case where a
space probe separates. The forces causing the separation are internal to the system, so that the net external horizontal force           is still
zero. The vertical component of the momentum is not conserved, because the net vertical force           is not zero. In the vertical direction,
the space probe-Earth system needs to be considered and we find that the total momentum is conserved. The center of mass of the space
probe takes the same path it would if the separation did not occur.

The conservation of momentum principle can be applied to systems as different as a comet striking Earth and a gas
containing huge numbers of atoms and molecules. Conservation of momentum is violated only when the net
external force is not zero. But another larger system can always be considered in which momentum is conserved by
simply including the source of the external force. For example, in the collision of two cars considered above, the
two-car system conserves momentum while each one-car system does not.

        Some aquatic animals such as jellyfish move around based on the principles of conservation of momentum. A
        jellyfish fills its umbrella section with water and then pushes the water out resulting in motion in the opposite
        direction to that of the jet of water. Squids propel themselves in a similar manner but, in contrast with jellyfish,
        are able to control the direction in which they move by aiming their nozzle forward or backward. Typical squids
        can move at speeds of 8 to 12 km/h.

        The ballistocardiograph (BCG) was a diagnostic tool used in the second half of the 20th century to study the
        strength of the heart. About once a second, your heart beats, forcing blood into the aorta. A force in the opposite
        direction is exerted on the rest of your body (recall Newton’s third law). A ballistocardiograph is a device that can
        measure this reaction force. This measurement is done by using a sensor (resting on the person) or by using a
        moving table suspended from the ceiling. This technique can gather information on the strength of the heart
        beat and the volume of blood passing from the heart. However, the electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) and the
        echocardiogram (cardiac ECHO or ECHO; a technique that uses ultrasound to see an image of the heart) are
        more widely used in the practice of cardiology.



        Making Connections: Conservation of Momentum and Collision
        Conservation of momentum is quite useful in describing collisions. Momentum is crucial to our understanding of
        atomic and subatomic particles because much of what we know about these particles comes from collision
        experiments.


      Subatomic Collisions and Momentum
      The conservation of momentum principle not only applies to the macroscopic objects, it is also essential to our
      explorations of atomic and subatomic particles. Giant machines hurl subatomic particles at one another, and
      researchers evaluate the results by assuming conservation of momentum (among other things).

      On the small scale, we find that particles and their properties are invisible to the naked eye but can be measured
      with our instruments, and models of these subatomic particles can be constructed to describe the results.
      Momentum is found to be a property of all subatomic particles including massless particles such as photons that
      compose light. Momentum being a property of particles hints that momentum may have an identity beyond the
      description of an object’s mass multiplied by the object’s velocity. Indeed, momentum relates to wave properties
      and plays a fundamental role in what measurements are taken and how we take these measurements. Furthermore,
      we find that the conservation of momentum principle is valid when considering systems of particles. We use this
      principle to analyze the masses and other properties of previously undetected particles, such as the nucleus of an
      atom and the existence of quarks that make up particles of nuclei. Figure 8.5 below illustrates how a particle
      scattering backward from another implies that its target is massive and dense. Experiments seeking evidence that

(nuclei of hydrogen atoms). Electrons occasionally scattered straight backward in a manner that implied a very small
and very dense particle makes up the proton—this observation is considered nearly direct evidence of quarks. The
analysis was based partly on the same conservation of momentum principle that works so well on the large scale.

8.4 Elastic Collisions in One Dimension
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Describe an elastic collision of two objects in one dimension.
 • Define internal kinetic energy.
 • Derive an expression for conservation of internal kinetic energy in a one dimensional collision.
 • Determine the final velocities in an elastic collision given masses and initial velocities.

Let us consider various types of two-object collisions. These collisions are the easiest to analyze, and they illustrate
many of the physical principles involved in collisions. The conservation of momentum principle is very useful here,
and it can be used whenever the net external force on a system is zero.

We start with the elastic collision of two objects moving along the same line—a one-dimensional problem. An elastic
collision is one that also conserves internal kinetic energy. Internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic
energies of the objects in the system. Figure 8.6 illustrates an elastic collision in which internal kinetic energy and
momentum are conserved.

Truly elastic collisions can only be achieved with subatomic particles, such as electrons striking nuclei. Macroscopic
collisions can be very nearly, but not quite, elastic—some kinetic energy is always converted into other forms of
energy such as heat transfer due to friction and sound. One macroscopic collision that is nearly elastic is that of two
steel blocks on ice. Another nearly elastic collision is that between two carts with spring bumpers on an air track. Icy
surfaces and air tracks are nearly frictionless, more readily allowing nearly elastic collisions on them.

      Now, to solve problems involving one-dimensional elastic collisions between two objects we can use the equations
      for conservation of momentum and conservation of internal kinetic energy. First, the equation for conservation of
      momentum for two objects in a one-dimensional collision is
                                                                                                                                   8.33
      or
                                                                                                                                   8.34
      where the primes (') indicate values after the collision. By definition, an elastic collision conserves internal kinetic
      energy, and so the sum of kinetic energies before the collision equals the sum after the collision. Thus,

                                                                                                                                   8.35

      expresses the equation for conservation of internal kinetic energy in a one-dimensional collision.


              EXAMPLE 8.4

      Calculating Velocities Following an Elastic Collision
      Calculate the velocities of two objects following an elastic collision, given that

                                                                                                                                   8.36

      Strategy and Concept

      First, visualize what the initial conditions mean—a small object strikes a larger object that is initially at rest. This
      situation is slightly simpler than the situation shown in Figure 8.6 where both objects are initially moving. We are
      asked to find two unknowns (the final velocities       and    ). To find two unknowns, we must use two independent
      equations. Because this collision is elastic, we can use the above two equations. Both can be simplified by the fact
      that object 2 is initially at rest, and thus      . Once we simplify these equations, we combine them algebraically
      to solve for the unknowns.

Solution

For this problem, note that          and use conservation of momentum. Thus,
                                                                                                                      8.37
or
                                                                                                                      8.38
Using conservation of internal kinetic energy and that          ,

                                                                                                                      8.39

Solving the first equation (momentum equation) for        , we obtain

                                                                                                                      8.40

Substituting this expression into the second equation (internal kinetic energy equation) eliminates the variable           ,
leaving only     as an unknown (the algebra is left as an exercise for the reader). There are two solutions to any
quadratic equation; in this example, they are
                                                                                                                      8.41
and
                                                                                                                      8.42
As noted when quadratic equations were encountered in earlier chapters, both solutions may or may not be
meaningful. In this case, the first solution is the same as the initial condition. The first solution thus represents the
situation before the collision and is discarded. The second solution                          is negative, meaning that the
first object bounces backward. When this negative value of         is used to find the velocity of the second object after
the collision, we get

                                                                                                                      8.43

or
                                                                                                                      8.44

Discussion

The result of this example is intuitively reasonable. A small object strikes a larger one at rest and bounces backward.
The larger one is knocked forward, but with a low speed. (This is like a compact car bouncing backward off a full-size
SUV that is initially at rest.) As a check, try calculating the internal kinetic energy before and after the collision. You
will see that the internal kinetic energy is unchanged at 4.00 J. Also check the total momentum before and after the
collision; you will find it, too, is unchanged.

The equations for conservation of momentum and internal kinetic energy as written above can be used to describe
any one-dimensional elastic collision of two objects. These equations can be extended to more objects if needed.

      8.5 Inelastic Collisions in One Dimension
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define inelastic collision.
       • Explain perfectly inelastic collision.
       • Apply an understanding of collisions to sports.
       • Determine recoil velocity and loss in kinetic energy given mass and initial velocity.

      We have seen that in an elastic collision, internal kinetic energy is conserved. An inelastic collision is one in which
      the internal kinetic energy changes (it is not conserved). This lack of conservation means that the forces between
      colliding objects may remove or add internal kinetic energy. Work done by internal forces may change the forms of
      energy within a system. For inelastic collisions, such as when colliding objects stick together, this internal work may
      transform some internal kinetic energy into heat transfer. Or it may convert stored energy into internal kinetic
      energy, such as when exploding bolts separate a satellite from its launch vehicle.


        Inelastic Collision
        An inelastic collision is one in which the internal kinetic energy changes (it is not conserved).


      Figure 8.7 shows an example of an inelastic collision. Two objects that have equal masses head toward one another
      at equal speeds and then stick together. Their total internal kinetic energy is initially                 . The
      two objects come to rest after sticking together, conserving momentum. But the internal kinetic energy is zero after
      the collision. A collision in which the objects stick together is sometimes called a perfectly inelastic collision
      because it reduces internal kinetic energy more than does any other type of inelastic collision. In fact, such a
      collision reduces internal kinetic energy to the minimum it can have while still conserving momentum.


        Perfectly Inelastic Collision
        A collision in which the objects stick together is sometimes called “perfectly inelastic.”

collision), and so their final velocity is zero. The internal kinetic energy of the system changes in any inelastic collision and is reduced to
zero in this example.


         EXAMPLE 8.5

Calculating Velocity and Change in Kinetic Energy: Inelastic Collision of a Puck and a Goalie
(a) Find the recoil velocity of a 70.0-kg ice hockey goalie, originally at rest, who catches a 0.150-kg hockey puck
slapped at him at a velocity of 35.0 m/s. (b) How much kinetic energy is lost during the collision? Assume friction
between the ice and the puck-goalie system is negligible. (See Figure 8.8 )




FIGURE 8.8 An ice hockey goalie catches a hockey puck and recoils backward. The initial kinetic energy of the puck is almost entirely
converted to thermal energy and sound in this inelastic collision.

Strategy

Momentum is conserved because the net external force on the puck-goalie system is zero. We can thus use
conservation of momentum to find the final velocity of the puck and goalie system. Note that the initial velocity of
the goalie is zero and that the final velocity of the puck and goalie are the same. Once the final velocity is found, the
kinetic energies can be calculated before and after the collision and compared as requested.

Solution for (a)

Momentum is conserved because the net external force on the puck-goalie system is zero.

Conservation of momentum is
                                                                                                                                            8.45
or
                                                                                                                                            8.46
Because the goalie is initially at rest, we know       . Because the goalie catches the puck, the final velocities are
equal, or                 . Thus, the conservation of momentum equation simplifies to
                                                                                                                                            8.47
Solving for      yields

                                                                                                                                            8.48

Entering known values in this equation, we get

                                                                                                                                            8.49

Discussion for (a)

This recoil velocity is small and in the same direction as the puck’s original velocity, as we might expect.
338   8 • Linear Momentum and Collisions



      Solution for (b)

      Before the collision, the internal kinetic energy               of the system is that of the hockey puck, because the goalie is
      initially at rest. Therefore,      is initially


                                                                                                                                          8.50


      After the collision, the internal kinetic energy is


                                                                                                                                          8.51


      The change in internal kinetic energy is thus

                                                                                                                                          8.52

      where the minus sign indicates that the energy was lost.

      Discussion for (b)

      Nearly all of the initial internal kinetic energy is lost in this perfectly inelastic collision.               is mostly converted to
      thermal energy and sound.

      During some collisions, the objects do not stick together and less of the internal kinetic energy is removed—such as
      happens in most automobile accidents. Alternatively, stored energy may be converted into internal kinetic energy
      during a collision. Figure 8.9 shows a one-dimensional example in which two carts on an air track collide, releasing
      potential energy from a compressed spring. Example 8.6 deals with data from such a collision.




      FIGURE 8.9 An air track is nearly frictionless, so that momentum is conserved. Motion is one-dimensional. In this collision, examined in
      Example 8.6, the potential energy of a compressed spring is released during the collision and is converted to internal kinetic energy.

      Collisions are particularly important in sports and the sporting and leisure industry utilizes elastic and inelastic
      collisions. Let us look briefly at tennis. Recall that in a collision, it is momentum and not force that is important. So, a
      heavier tennis racquet will have the advantage over a lighter one. This conclusion also holds true for other sports—a
      lightweight bat (such as a softball bat) cannot hit a hardball very far.

The location of the impact of the tennis ball on the racquet is also important, as is the part of the stroke during which
the impact occurs. A smooth motion results in the maximizing of the velocity of the ball after impact and reduces
sports injuries such as tennis elbow. A tennis player tries to hit the ball on the “sweet spot” on the racquet, where
the vibration and impact are minimized and the ball is able to be given more velocity. Sports science and
technologies also use physics concepts such as momentum and rotational motion and vibrations.



  Take-Home Experiment—Bouncing of Tennis Ball
  1. Find a racquet (a tennis, badminton, or other racquet will do). Place the racquet on the floor and stand on
     the handle. Drop a tennis ball on the strings from a measured height. Measure how high the ball bounces.
     Now ask a friend to hold the racquet firmly by the handle and drop a tennis ball from the same measured
     height above the racquet. Measure how high the ball bounces and observe what happens to your friend’s
     hand during the collision. Explain your observations and measurements.
  2. The coefficient of restitution     is a measure of the elasticity of a collision between a ball and an object, and
     is defined as the ratio of the speeds after and before the collision. A perfectly elastic collision has a of 1.
     For a ball bouncing off the floor (or a racquet on the floor), can be shown to be                   where is the
     height to which the ball bounces and       is the height from which the ball is dropped. Determine for the
     cases in Part 1 and for the case of a tennis ball bouncing off a concrete or wooden floor (             for new
     tennis balls used on a tennis court).



       EXAMPLE 8.6

Calculating Final Velocity and Energy Release: Two Carts Collide
In the collision pictured in Figure 8.9, two carts collide inelastically. Cart 1 (denoted      carries a spring which is
initially compressed. During the collision, the spring releases its potential energy and converts it to internal kinetic
energy. The mass of cart 1 and the spring is 0.350 kg, and the cart and the spring together have an initial velocity of
           . Cart 2 (denoted    in Figure 8.9) has a mass of 0.500 kg and an initial velocity of                . After the
collision, cart 1 is observed to recoil with a velocity of           . (a) What is the final velocity of cart 2? (b) How
much energy was released by the spring (assuming all of it was converted into internal kinetic energy)?

Strategy

We can use conservation of momentum to find the final velocity of cart 2, because             (the track is frictionless
and the force of the spring is internal). Once this velocity is determined, we can compare the internal kinetic energy
before and after the collision to see how much energy was released by the spring.

Solution for (a)

As before, the equation for conservation of momentum in a two-object system is
                                                                                                                       8.53
The only unknown in this equation is       . Solving for    and substituting known values into the previous equation
yields



                                                                                                                       8.54



Solution for (b)

The internal kinetic energy before the collision is

                                                                                                                            8.55



      After the collision, the internal kinetic energy is



                                                                                                                            8.56



      The change in internal kinetic energy is thus

                                                                                                                            8.57

      Discussion

      The final velocity of cart 2 is large and positive, meaning that it is moving to the right after the collision. The internal
      kinetic energy in this collision increases by 5.46 J. That energy was released by the spring.


      8.6 Collisions of Point Masses in Two Dimensions
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Discuss two dimensional collisions as an extension of one dimensional analysis.
       • Define point masses.
       • Derive an expression for conservation of momentum along x-axis and y-axis.
       • Describe elastic collisions of two objects with equal mass.
       • Determine the magnitude and direction of the final velocity given initial velocity, and scattering angle.

      In the previous two sections, we considered only one-dimensional collisions; during such collisions, the incoming
      and outgoing velocities are all along the same line. But what about collisions, such as those between billiard balls, in
      which objects scatter to the side? These are two-dimensional collisions, and we shall see that their study is an
      extension of the one-dimensional analysis already presented. The approach taken (similar to the approach in
      discussing two-dimensional kinematics and dynamics) is to choose a convenient coordinate system and resolve the
      motion into components along perpendicular axes. Resolving the motion yields a pair of one-dimensional problems
      to be solved simultaneously.

      One complication arising in two-dimensional collisions is that the objects might rotate before or after their collision.
      For example, if two ice skaters hook arms as they pass by one another, they will spin in circles. We will not consider
      such rotation until later, and so for now we arrange things so that no rotation is possible. To avoid rotation, we
      consider only the scattering of point masses—that is, structureless particles that cannot rotate or spin.

      We start by assuming that                , so that momentum is conserved. The simplest collision is one in which one of
      the particles is initially at rest. (See Figure 8.10.) The best choice for a coordinate system is one with an axis parallel
      to the velocity of the incoming particle, as shown in Figure 8.10. Because momentum is conserved, the components
      of momentum along the - and -axes                        will also be conserved, but with the chosen coordinate system,
          is initially zero and     is the momentum of the incoming particle. Both facts simplify the analysis. (Even with the
      simplifying assumptions of point masses, one particle initially at rest, and a convenient coordinate system, we still
      gain new insights into nature from the analysis of two-dimensional collisions.)

FIGURE 8.10 A two-dimensional collision with the coordinate system chosen so that             is initially at rest and is parallel to the -axis.
This coordinate system is sometimes called the laboratory coordinate system, because many scattering experiments have a target that is
stationary in the laboratory, while particles are scattered from it to determine the particles that make-up the target and how they are bound
together. The particles may not be observed directly, but their initial and final velocities are.

Along the -axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is

                                                                                                                                        8.58

Where the subscripts denote the particles and axes and the primes denote the situation after the collision. In terms
of masses and velocities, this equation is

                                                                               ′            ′

But because particle 2 is initially at rest, this equation becomes

                                                                                                                                        8.60

The components of the velocities along the -axis have the form                           . Because particle 1 initially moves along
the -axis, we find         .

Conservation of momentum along the -axis gives the following equation:

                                                                                                                                        8.61

where       and      are as shown in Figure 8.10.

Along the -axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is

                                                                                                                                        8.63

But       is zero, because particle 1 initially moves along the -axis. Because particle 2 is initially at rest,                      is also
zero. The equation for conservation of momentum along the -axis becomes

                                                                                                                                        8.65

The components of the velocities along the -axis have the form                          .

      Thus, conservation of momentum along the -axis gives the following equation:

                                                                                                                           8.66

      The equations of conservation of momentum along the -axis and -axis are very useful in analyzing two-
      dimensional collisions of particles, where one is originally stationary (a common laboratory situation). But two
      equations can only be used to find two unknowns, and so other data may be necessary when collision experiments
      are used to explore nature at the subatomic level.


              EXAMPLE 8.7

      Determining the Final Velocity of an Unseen Object from the Scattering of Another Object
      Suppose the following experiment is performed. A 0.250-kg object            is slid on a frictionless surface into a dark
      room, where it strikes an initially stationary object with mass of 0.400 kg        . The 0.250-kg object emerges from
      the room at an angle of        with its incoming direction.

      The speed of the 0.250-kg object is originally 2.00 m/s and is 1.50 m/s after the collision. Calculate the magnitude
      and direction of the velocity   and       of the 0.400-kg object after the collision.

      Strategy

      Momentum is conserved because the surface is frictionless. The coordinate system shown in Figure 8.11 is one in
      which    is originally at rest and the initial velocity is parallel to the -axis, so that conservation of momentum
      along the - and -axes is applicable.

      Everything is known in these equations except          and   , which are precisely the quantities we wish to find. We can
      find two unknowns because we have two independent equations: the equations describing the conservation of
      momentum in the - and -directions.

      Solution

      Solving                                          for            and                                    for            and
      taking the ratio yields an equation (in which θ2 is the only unknown quantity. Applying the identity                        ,
      we obtain:


                                                                                                                           8.68


      Entering known values into the previous equation gives

                                                                                                                           8.69

      Thus,

                                                                                                                           8.70

      Angles are defined as positive in the counter clockwise direction, so this angle indicates that      is scattered to the
      right in Figure 8.11, as expected (this angle is in the fourth quadrant). Either equation for the - or -axis can now be
      used to solve for     , but the latter equation is easiest because it has fewer terms.

                                                                                                                           8.71

Entering known values into this equation gives

                                                                                                                                         8.72

Thus,
                                                                                                                                         8.73

Discussion

It is instructive to calculate the internal kinetic energy of this two-object system before and after the collision. (This
calculation is left as an end-of-chapter problem.) If you do this calculation, you will find that the internal kinetic
energy is less after the collision, and so the collision is inelastic. This type of result makes a physicist want to
explore the system further.




FIGURE 8.11 A collision taking place in a dark room is explored in Example 8.7. The incoming object           is scattered by an initially
stationary object. Only the stationary object’s mass     is known. By measuring the angle and speed at which            emerges from the room, it
is possible to calculate the magnitude and direction of the initially stationary object’s velocity after the collision.

Elastic Collisions of Two Objects with Equal Mass
Some interesting situations arise when the two colliding objects have equal mass and the collision is elastic. This
situation is nearly the case with colliding billiard balls, and precisely the case with some subatomic particle
collisions. We can thus get a mental image of a collision of subatomic particles by thinking about billiards (or pool).
(Refer to Figure 8.10 for masses and angles.) First, an elastic collision conserves internal kinetic energy. Again, let us
assume object 2         is initially at rest. Then, the internal kinetic energy before and after the collision of two objects
that have equal masses is

                                                                                                                                         8.74

Because the masses are equal,            . Algebraic manipulation (left to the reader) of conservation of
momentum in the - and -directions can show that

                                                                                                                                         8.75

(Remember that           is negative here.) The two preceding equations can both be true only if

                                                                                                                                         8.76

      There are three ways that this term can be zero. They are

       •           : head-on collision; incoming ball stops
       •           : no collision; incoming ball continues unaffected
       •                      : angle of separation           is    after the collision

      All three of these ways are familiar occurrences in billiards and pool, although most of us try to avoid the second. If
      you play enough pool, you will notice that the angle between the balls is very close to          after the collision,
      although it will vary from this value if a great deal of spin is placed on the ball. (Large spin carries in extra energy and
      a quantity called angular momentum, which must also be conserved.) The assumption that the scattering of billiard
      balls is elastic is reasonable based on the correctness of the three results it produces. This assumption also implies
      that, to a good approximation, momentum is conserved for the two-ball system in billiards and pool. The problems
      below explore these and other characteristics of two-dimensional collisions.


        Connections to Nuclear and Particle Physics
        Two-dimensional collision experiments have revealed much of what we know about subatomic particles, as we
        shall see in Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics and Particle Physics. Ernest Rutherford, for example,
        discovered the nature of the atomic nucleus from such experiments.


      8.7 Introduction to Rocket Propulsion
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • State Newton’s third law of motion.
       • Explain the principle involved in propulsion of rockets and jet engines.
       • Derive an expression for the acceleration of the rocket and discuss the factors that affect the
          acceleration.
       • Describe the function of a space shuttle.

      Rockets range in size from fireworks so small that ordinary people use them to immense Saturn Vs that once
      propelled massive payloads toward the Moon. The propulsion of all rockets, jet engines, deflating balloons, and even
      squids and octopuses is explained by the same physical principle—Newton’s third law of motion. Matter is forcefully
      ejected from a system, producing an equal and opposite reaction on what remains. Another common example is the
      recoil of a gun. The gun exerts a force on a bullet to accelerate it and consequently experiences an equal and
      opposite force, causing the gun’s recoil or kick.


        Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Propulsion of a Balloon
        Hold a balloon and fill it with air. Then, let the balloon go. In which direction does the air come out of the balloon
        and in which direction does the balloon get propelled? If you fill the balloon with water and then let the balloon
        go, does the balloon’s direction change? Explain your answer.


      Figure 8.12 shows a rocket accelerating straight up. In part (a), the rocket has a mass and a velocity relative to
      Earth, and hence a momentum           . In part (b), a time  has elapsed in which the rocket has ejected a mass       of
      hot gas at a velocity    relative to the rocket. The remainder of the mass              now has a greater velocity
                 . The momentum of the entire system (rocket plus expelled gas) has actually decreased because the force
      of gravity has acted for a time , producing a negative impulse                    . (Remember that impulse is the net
      external force on a system multiplied by the time it acts, and it equals the change in momentum of the system.) So,
      the center of mass of the system is in free fall but, by rapidly expelling mass, part of the system can accelerate
      upward. It is a commonly held misconception that the rocket exhaust pushes on the ground. If we consider thrust;
      that is, the force exerted on the rocket by the exhaust gases, then a rocket’s thrust is greater in outer space than in
      the atmosphere or on the launch pad. In fact, gases are easier to expel into a vacuum.

      By calculating the change in momentum for the entire system over          , and equating this change to the impulse, the

following expression can be shown to be a good approximation for the acceleration of the rocket.

                                                                                                                                    8.77

“The rocket” is that part of the system remaining after the gas is ejected, and                is the acceleration due to gravity.


  Acceleration of a Rocket
  Acceleration of a rocket is

                                                                                                                                 8.78

  where is the acceleration of the rocket,    is the exhaust velocity,                is the mass of the rocket,         is the mass
  of the ejected gas, and  is the time in which the gas is ejected.




FIGURE 8.12 (a) This rocket has a mass and an upward velocity . The net external force on the system is         , if air resistance is
neglected. (b) A time   later the system has two main parts, the ejected gas and the remainder of the rocket. The reaction force on the
rocket is what overcomes the gravitational force and accelerates it upward.

A rocket’s acceleration depends on three major factors, consistent with the equation for acceleration of a rocket .
First, the greater the exhaust velocity of the gases relative to the rocket, , the greater the acceleration is. The
practical limit for    is about                 for conventional (non-nuclear) hot-gas propulsion systems. The second
factor is the rate at which mass is ejected from the rocket. This is the factor           in the equation. The quantity
             , with units of newtons, is called "thrust.” The faster the rocket burns its fuel, the greater its thrust, and
the greater its acceleration. The third factor is the mass of the rocket. The smaller the mass is (all other factors
being the same), the greater the acceleration. The rocket mass decreases dramatically during flight because most
of the rocket is fuel to begin with, so that acceleration increases continuously, reaching a maximum just before the
fuel is exhausted.
346   8 • Linear Momentum and Collisions




        Factors Affecting a Rocket’s Acceleration
         • The greater the exhaust velocity      of the gases relative to the rocket, the greater the acceleration.
         • The faster the rocket burns its fuel, the greater its acceleration.
         • The smaller the rocket’s mass (all other factors being the same), the greater the acceleration.



              EXAMPLE 8.8

      Calculating Acceleration: Initial Acceleration of a Moon Launch
      A Saturn V’s mass at liftoff was                 , its fuel-burn rate was                , and the exhaust velocity was
                     . Calculate its initial acceleration.

      Strategy

      This problem is a straightforward application of the expression for acceleration because       is the unknown and all of
      the terms on the right side of the equation are given.

      Solution

      Substituting the given values into the equation for acceleration yields



                                                                                                                          8.79



      Discussion

      This value is fairly small, even for an initial acceleration. The acceleration does increase steadily as the rocket burns
      fuel, because decreases while          and        remain constant. Knowing this acceleration and the mass of the rocket,
      you can show that the thrust of the engines was                   .


      To achieve the high speeds needed to hop continents, obtain orbit, or escape Earth’s gravity altogether, the mass of
      the rocket other than fuel must be as small as possible. It can be shown that, in the absence of air resistance and
      neglecting gravity, the final velocity of a one-stage rocket initially at rest is

                                                                                                                          8.80

      where                is the natural logarithm of the ratio of the initial mass of the rocket    to what is left    after
      all of the fuel is exhausted. (Note that is actually the change in velocity, so the equation can be used for any
      segment of the flight. If we start from rest, the change in velocity equals the final velocity.) For example, let us
      calculate the mass ratio needed to escape Earth’s gravity starting from rest, given that the escape velocity from
      Earth is about                    , and assuming an exhaust velocity                         .

                                                                                                                          8.81

      Solving for         gives

This result means that only           of the mass is left when the fuel is burnt, and      of the initial mass was fuel.
Expressed as percentages, 98.9% of the rocket is fuel, while payload, engines, fuel tanks, and other components
make up only 1.10%. Taking air resistance and gravitational force into account, the mass            remaining can only be
about          . It is difficult to build a rocket in which the fuel has a mass 180 times everything else. The solution is
multistage rockets. Each stage only needs to achieve part of the final velocity and is discarded after it burns its fuel.
The result is that each successive stage can have smaller engines and more payload relative to its fuel. Once out of
the atmosphere, the ratio of payload to fuel becomes more favorable, too.

The space shuttle was an attempt at an economical vehicle with some reusable parts, such as the solid fuel
boosters and the craft itself. (See Figure 8.13) The shuttle’s need to be operated by humans, however, made it at
least as costly for launching satellites as expendable, unpiloted rockets. Ideally, the shuttle would only have been
used when human activities were required for the success of a mission, such as the repair of the Hubble space
telescope. Rockets with satellites can also be launched from airplanes. Using airplanes has the double advantage
that the initial velocity is significantly above zero and a rocket can avoid most of the atmosphere’s resistance.




FIGURE 8.13 The space shuttle had a number of reusable parts. Solid fuel boosters on either side were recovered and refueled after each
flight, and the entire orbiter returned to Earth for use in subsequent flights. The large liquid fuel tank was expended. The space shuttle was
a complex assemblage of technologies, employing both solid and liquid fuel and pioneering ceramic tiles as reentry heat shields. As a
result, it permitted multiple launches as opposed to single-use rockets. (credit: NASA)

INTRODUCTION TO STATICS AND TORQUE What might desks, bridges, buildings, trees, and mountains have in
common—at least in the eyes of a physicist? The answer is that they are ordinarily motionless relative to the Earth.
Furthermore, their acceleration is zero because they remain motionless. That means they also have something in
common with a car moving at a constant velocity, because anything with a constant velocity also has an acceleration
of zero. Now, the important part—Newton’s second law states that net              , and so the net external force is zero
for all stationary objects and for all objects moving at constant velocity. There are forces acting, but they are
balanced. That is, they are in equilibrium.


  Statics
  Statics is the study of forces in equilibrium, a large group of situations that makes up a special case of Newton’s
  second law. We have already considered a few such situations; in this chapter, we cover the topic more
  thoroughly, including consideration of such possible effects as the rotation and deformation of an object by the
358   9 • Statics and Torque



        forces acting on it.


      How can we guarantee that a body is in equilibrium and what can we learn from systems that are in equilibrium?
      There are actually two conditions that must be satisfied to achieve equilibrium. These conditions are the topics of
      the first two sections of this chapter.

      9.1 The First Condition for Equilibrium
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • State the first condition of equilibrium.
       • Explain static equilibrium.
       • Explain dynamic equilibrium.

      The first condition necessary to achieve equilibrium is the one already mentioned: the net external force on the
      system must be zero. Expressed as an equation, this is simply
                                                                                                                                               9.1
      Note that if net is zero, then the net external force in any direction is zero. For example, the net external forces
      along the typical x- and y-axes are zero. This is written as

                                                                                                                                               9.2

      Figure 9.2 and Figure 9.3 illustrate situations where                        for both static equilibrium (motionless), and
      dynamic equilibrium (constant velocity).




        FIGURE 9.2 This motionless person is in static equilibrium. The forces acting on him add up to zero. Both forces are vertical in this case.




      FIGURE 9.3 This car is in dynamic equilibrium because it is moving at constant velocity. There are horizontal and vertical forces, but the net
      external force in any direction is zero. The applied force   between the tires and the road is balanced by air friction, and the weight of
      the car is supported by the normal forces, here shown to be equal for all four tires.

      However, it is not sufficient for the net external force of a system to be zero for a system to be in equilibrium.
      Consider the two situations illustrated in Figure 9.4 and Figure 9.5 where forces are applied to an ice hockey stick

lying flat on ice. The net external force is zero in both situations shown in the figure; but in one case, equilibrium is
achieved, whereas in the other, it is not. In Figure 9.4, the ice hockey stick remains motionless. But in Figure 9.5,
with the same forces applied in different places, the stick experiences accelerated rotation. Therefore, we know that
the point at which a force is applied is another factor in determining whether or not equilibrium is achieved. This will
be explored further in the next section.

gravitational force is balanced by the support of the ice (a normal force). Thus,         . Equilibrium is achieved, which is static

9.2 The Second Condition for Equilibrium
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • State the second condition that is necessary to achieve equilibrium.
 • Explain torque and the factors on which it depends.
 • Describe the role of torque in rotational mechanics.


  Torque
  The second condition necessary to achieve equilibrium involves avoiding accelerated rotation (maintaining a
360   9 • Statics and Torque



        constant angular velocity). A rotating body or system can be in equilibrium if its rate of rotation is constant and
        remains unchanged by the forces acting on it. To understand what factors affect rotation, let us think about what
        happens when you open an ordinary door by rotating it on its hinges.


      Several familiar factors determine how effective you are in opening the door. See Figure 9.6. First of all, the larger
      the force, the more effective it is in opening the door—obviously, the harder you push, the more rapidly the door
      opens. Also, the point at which you push is crucial. If you apply your force too close to the hinges, the door will open
      slowly, if at all. Most people have been embarrassed by making this mistake and bumping up against a door when it
      did not open as quickly as expected. Finally, the direction in which you push is also important. The most effective
      direction is perpendicular to the door—we push in this direction almost instinctively.




      FIGURE 9.6 Torque is the turning or twisting effectiveness of a force, illustrated here for door rotation on its hinges (as viewed from
      overhead). Torque has both magnitude and direction. (a) Counterclockwise torque is produced by this force, which means that the door will
      rotate in a counterclockwise due to . Note that       is the perpendicular distance of the pivot from the line of action of the force. (b) A
      smaller counterclockwise torque is produced by a smaller force        acting at the same distance from the hinges (the pivot point). (c) The
      same force as in (a) produces a smaller counterclockwise torque when applied at a smaller distance from the hinges. (d) The same force as
      in (a), but acting in the opposite direction, produces a clockwise torque. (e) A smaller counterclockwise torque is produced by the same
      magnitude force acting at the same point but in a different direction. Here, is less than      . (f) Torque is zero here since the force just pulls
      on the hinges, producing no rotation. In this case,         .

      The magnitude, direction, and point of application of the force are incorporated into the definition of the physical
      quantity called torque. Torque is the rotational equivalent of a force. It is a measure of the effectiveness of a force in
      changing or accelerating a rotation (changing the angular velocity over a period of time). In equation form, the
      magnitude of torque is defined to be
                                                                                                                                                   9.3
      where (the Greek letter tau) is the symbol for torque, is the distance from the pivot point to the point where the
      force is applied, is the magnitude of the force, and is the angle between the force and the vector directed from
      the point of application to the pivot point, as seen in Figure 9.6 and Figure 9.7. An alternative expression for torque
      is given in terms of the perpendicular lever arm        as shown in Figure 9.6 and Figure 9.7, which is defined as
                                                                                                                                                   9.4

FIGURE 9.7 A force applied to an object can produce a torque, which depends on the location of the pivot point. (a) The three factors , ,
and for pivot point A on a body are shown here— is the distance from the chosen pivot point to the point where the force is applied,
and is the angle between and the vector directed from the point of application to the pivot point. If the object can rotate around point A,
it will rotate counterclockwise. This means that torque is counterclockwise relative to pivot A. (b) In this case, point B is the pivot point. The
torque from the applied force will cause a clockwise rotation around point B, and so it is a clockwise torque relative to B.

The perpendicular lever arm     is the shortest distance from the pivot point to the line along which acts; it is
shown as a dashed line in Figure 9.6 and Figure 9.7. Note that the line segment that defines the distance     is
perpendicular to , as its name implies. It is sometimes easier to find or visualize     than to find both and . In
such cases, it may be more convenient to use            rather than               for torque, but both are equally
valid.

The SI unit of torque is newtons times meters, usually written as           . For example, if you push perpendicular to
the door with a force of 40 N at a distance of 0.800 m from the hinges, you exert a torque of 32 N·m(0.800 m × 40 N
× sin 90º) relative to the hinges. If you reduce the force to 20 N, the torque is reduced to         , and so on.

The torque is always calculated with reference to some chosen pivot point. For the same applied force, a different
choice for the location of the pivot will give you a different value for the torque, since both and depend on the
location of the pivot. Any point in any object can be chosen to calculate the torque about that point. The object may
not actually pivot about the chosen “pivot point.”

Note that for rotation in a plane, torque has two possible directions. Torque is either clockwise or counterclockwise
relative to the chosen pivot point, as illustrated for points B and A, respectively, in Figure 9.7. If the object can rotate
about point A, it will rotate counterclockwise, which means that the torque for the force is shown as
counterclockwise relative to A. But if the object can rotate about point B, it will rotate clockwise, which means the
torque for the force shown is clockwise relative to B. Also, the magnitude of the torque is greater when the lever arm
is longer.

Now, the second condition necessary to achieve equilibrium is that the net external torque on a system must be
zero. An external torque is one that is created by an external force. You can choose the point around which the
torque is calculated. The point can be the physical pivot point of a system or any other point in space—but it must be
the same point for all torques. If the second condition (net external torque on a system is zero) is satisfied for one
choice of pivot point, it will also hold true for any other choice of pivot point in or out of the system of interest. (This
is true only in an inertial frame of reference.) The second condition necessary to achieve equilibrium is stated in
equation form as
                                                                                                                                            9.6
where net means total. Torques, which are in opposite directions are assigned opposite signs. A common
convention is to call counterclockwise (ccw) torques positive and clockwise (cw) torques negative.

When two children balance a seesaw as shown in Figure 9.8, they satisfy the two conditions for equilibrium. Most
people have perfect intuition about seesaws, knowing that the lighter child must sit farther from the pivot and that a
heavier child can keep a lighter one off the ground indefinitely.
362   9 • Statics and Torque




      FIGURE 9.8 Two children balancing a seesaw satisfy both conditions for equilibrium. The lighter child sits farther from the pivot to create a
      torque equal in magnitude to that of the heavier child.


              EXAMPLE 9.1

      She Saw Torques On A Seesaw
      The two children shown in Figure 9.8 are balanced on a seesaw of negligible mass. (This assumption is made to
      keep the example simple—more involved examples will follow.) The first child has a mass of 26.0 kg and sits 1.60 m
      from the pivot.(a) If the second child has a mass of 32.0 kg, how far is she from the pivot? (b) What is , the
      supporting force exerted by the pivot?

      Strategy

      Both conditions for equilibrium must be satisfied. In part (a), we are asked for a distance; thus, the second condition
      (regarding torques) must be used, since the first (regarding only forces) has no distances in it. To apply the second
      condition for equilibrium, we first identify the system of interest to be the seesaw plus the two children. We take the
      supporting pivot to be the point about which the torques are calculated. We then identify all external forces acting
      on the system.

      Solution (a)

      The three external forces acting on the system are the weights of the two children and the supporting force of the
      pivot. Let us examine the torque produced by each. Torque is defined to be
                                                                                                                                              9.7

      negative by convention. Since    acts directly on the pivot point, the distance is zero. A force acting on the pivot
      cannot cause a rotation, just as pushing directly on the hinges of a door will not cause it to rotate. Now, the second
      condition for equilibrium is that the sum of the torques on both children is zero. Therefore

Weight is mass times the acceleration due to gravity. Entering       for    , we get
                                                                                                                          9.13

The quantities on the right side of the equation are known; thus,      is

                                                                                                                          9.15

As expected, the heavier child must sit closer to the pivot (1.30 m versus 1.60 m) to balance the seesaw.

Solution (b)

This part asks for a force   . The easiest way to find it is to use the first condition for equilibrium, which is
                                                                                                                          9.16
The forces are all vertical, so that we are dealing with a one-dimensional problem along the vertical axis; hence, the
condition can be written as

                                                                                                                          9.17

where we again call the vertical axis the y-axis. Choosing upward to be the positive direction, and using plus and
minus signs to indicate the directions of the forces, we see that

                                                                                                                          9.18

This equation yields what might have been guessed at the beginning:

                                                                                                                          9.19

So, the pivot supplies a supporting force equal to the total weight of the system:

                                                                                                                          9.20

Entering known values gives


                                                                                                                          9.21


Discussion

The two results make intuitive sense. The heavier child sits closer to the pivot. The pivot supports the weight of the
two children. Part (b) can also be solved using the second condition for equilibrium, since both distances are known,
but only if the pivot point is chosen to be somewhere other than the location of the seesaw’s actual pivot!


Several aspects of the preceding example have broad implications. First, the choice of the pivot as the point around
which torques are calculated simplified the problem. Since   is exerted on the pivot point, its lever arm is zero.
Hence, the torque exerted by the supporting force        is zero relative to that pivot point. The second condition for
equilibrium holds for any choice of pivot point, and so we choose the pivot point to simplify the solution of the
problem.

Second, the acceleration due to gravity canceled in this problem, and we were left with a ratio of masses. This will
not always be the case. Always enter the correct forces—do not jump ahead to enter some ratio of masses.

Third, the weight of each child is distributed over an area of the seesaw, yet we treated the weights as if each force
364   9 • Statics and Torque



      were exerted at a single point. This is not an approximation—the distances       and    are the distances to points
      directly below the center of gravity of each child. As we shall see in the next section, the mass and weight of a
      system can act as if they are located at a single point.

      Finally, note that the concept of torque has an importance beyond static equilibrium. Torque plays the same role in
      rotational motion that force plays in linear motion. We will examine this in the next chapter.

        on the round side of the cylinder while everything remains still. Put a penny 8 cm away from the pivot. Where
        would you need to put two pennies to balance? Three pennies?


      9.3 Stability
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • State the types of equilibrium.
       • Describe stable and unstable equilibriums.
       • Describe neutral equilibrium.

      It is one thing to have a system in equilibrium; it is quite another for it to be stable. The toy doll perched on the
      man’s hand in Figure 9.9, for example, is not in stable equilibrium. There are three types of equilibrium: stable,
      unstable, and neutral. Figures throughout this module illustrate various examples.

      Figure 9.9 presents a balanced system, such as the toy doll on the man’s hand, which has its center of gravity (cg)
      directly over the pivot, so that the torque of the total weight is zero. This is equivalent to having the torques of the
      individual parts balanced about the pivot point, in this case the hand. The cgs of the arms, legs, head, and torso are
      labeled with smaller type.




                                            FIGURE 9.9 A man balances a toy doll on one hand.

      A system is said to be in stable equilibrium if, when displaced from equilibrium, it experiences a net force or torque
      in a direction opposite to the direction of the displacement. For example, a marble at the bottom of a bowl will
      experience a restoring force when displaced from its equilibrium position. This force moves it back toward the
      equilibrium position. Most systems are in stable equilibrium, especially for small displacements. For another
      example of stable equilibrium, see the pencil in Figure 9.10.

 FIGURE 9.10 This pencil is in the condition of equilibrium. The net force on the pencil is zero and the total torque about any pivot is zero.

A system is in unstable equilibrium if, when displaced, it experiences a net force or torque in the same direction as
the displacement from equilibrium. A system in unstable equilibrium accelerates away from its equilibrium position
if displaced even slightly. An obvious example is a ball resting on top of a hill. Once displaced, it accelerates away
from the crest. See the next several figures for examples of unstable equilibrium.




FIGURE 9.11 If the pencil is displaced slightly to the side (counterclockwise), it is no longer in equilibrium. Its weight produces a clockwise
torque that returns the pencil to its equilibrium position.




FIGURE 9.12 If the pencil is displaced too far, the torque caused by its weight changes direction to counterclockwise and causes the
displacement to increase.

                      FIGURE 9.13 This figure shows unstable equilibrium, although both conditions for equilibrium are satisfied.




      FIGURE 9.14 If the pencil is displaced even slightly, a torque is created by its weight that is in the same direction as the displacement,
      causing the displacement to increase.

      A system is in neutral equilibrium if its equilibrium is independent of displacements from its original position. A
      marble on a flat horizontal surface is an example. Combinations of these situations are possible. For example, a
      marble on a saddle is stable for displacements toward the front or back of the saddle and unstable for
      displacements to the side. Figure 9.15 shows another example of neutral equilibrium.

FIGURE 9.15 (a) Here we see neutral equilibrium. The cg of a sphere on a flat surface lies directly above the point of support, independent
of the position on the surface. The sphere is therefore in equilibrium in any location, and if displaced, it will remain put. (b) Because it has a
circular cross section, the pencil is in neutral equilibrium for displacements perpendicular to its length.

When we consider how far a system in stable equilibrium can be displaced before it becomes unstable, we find that
some systems in stable equilibrium are more stable than others. The pencil in Figure 9.10 and the person in Figure
9.16(a) are in stable equilibrium, but become unstable for relatively small displacements to the side. The critical
point is reached when the cg is no longer above the base of support. Additionally, since the cg of a person’s body is
above the pivots in the hips, displacements must be quickly controlled. This control is a central nervous system
function that is developed when we learn to hold our bodies erect as infants. For increased stability while standing,
the feet should be spread apart, giving a larger base of support. Stability is also increased by lowering one’s center
of gravity by bending the knees, as when a football player prepares to receive a ball or braces themselves for a
tackle. A cane, a crutch, or a walker increases the stability of the user, even more as the base of support widens.
Usually, the cg of a female is lower (closer to the ground) than a male. Young children have their center of gravity
between their shoulders, which increases the challenge of learning to walk.




FIGURE 9.16 (a) The center of gravity of an adult is above the hip joints (one of the main pivots in the body) and lies between two narrowly-
separated feet. Like a pencil standing on its eraser, this person is in stable equilibrium in relation to sideways displacements, but relatively
small displacements take his cg outside the base of support and make him unstable. Humans are less stable relative to forward and
368   9 • Statics and Torque



      backward displacements because the feet are not very long. Muscles are used extensively to balance the body in the front-to-back
      direction. (b) While bending in the manner shown, stability is increased by lowering the center of gravity. Stability is also increased if the
      base is expanded by placing the feet farther apart.

      Animals such as chickens have easier systems to control. Figure 9.17 shows that the cg of a chicken lies below its
      hip joints and between its widely separated and broad feet. Even relatively large displacements of the chicken’s cg
      are stable and result in restoring forces and torques that return the cg to its equilibrium position with little effort on
      the chicken’s part. Not all birds are like chickens, of course. Some birds, such as the flamingo, have balance systems
      that are almost as sophisticated as that of humans.

      Figure 9.17 shows that the cg of a chicken is below the hip joints and lies above a broad base of support formed by
      widely-separated and large feet. Hence, the chicken is in very stable equilibrium, since a relatively large
      displacement is needed to render it unstable. The body of the chicken is supported from above by the hips and acts
      as a pendulum between the hips. Therefore, the chicken is stable for front-to-back displacements as well as for
      side-to-side displacements.




      FIGURE 9.17 The center of gravity of a chicken is below the hip joints. The chicken is in stable equilibrium. The body of the chicken is
      supported from above by the hips and acts as a pendulum between them.

      Engineers and architects strive to achieve extremely stable equilibriums for buildings and other systems that must
      withstand wind, earthquakes, and other forces that displace them from equilibrium. Although the examples in this
      section emphasize gravitational forces, the basic conditions for equilibrium are the same for all types of forces. The
      net external force must be zero, and the net torque must also be zero.

      9.4 Applications of Statics, Including Problem-Solving Strategies
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Discuss the applications of Statics in real life.
       • State and discuss various problem-solving strategies in Statics.

      Statics can be applied to a variety of situations, ranging from raising a drawbridge to bad posture and back strain.
      We begin with a discussion of problem-solving strategies specifically used for statics. Since statics is a special case
      of Newton’s laws, both the general problem-solving strategies and the special strategies for Newton’s laws,
      discussed in Problem-Solving Strategies, still apply.


        Problem-Solving Strategy: Static Equilibrium Situations
         1. The first step is to determine whether or not the system is in static equilibrium. This condition is always the
            case when the acceleration of the system is zero and accelerated rotation does not occur.

  2. It is particularly important to draw a free body diagram for the system of interest. Carefully label all forces,
     and note their relative magnitudes, directions, and points of application whenever these are known.
  3. Solve the problem by applying either or both of the conditions for equilibrium (represented by the equations
                  and            , depending on the list of known and unknown factors. If the second condition is
     involved, choose the pivot point to simplify the solution. Any pivot point can be chosen, but the most useful
     ones cause torques by unknown forces to be zero. (Torque is zero if the force is applied at the pivot (then
            ), or along a line through the pivot point (then      )). Always choose a convenient coordinate system
     for projecting forces.
  4. Check the solution to see if it is reasonable by examining the magnitude, direction, and units of the answer.
     The importance of this last step never diminishes, although in unfamiliar applications, it is usually more
     difficult to judge reasonableness. These judgments become progressively easier with experience.


Now let us apply this problem-solving strategy for the pole vaulter shown in the three figures below. The pole is
uniform and has a mass of 5.00 kg. In Figure 9.18, the pole’s cg lies halfway between the vaulter’s hands. It seems
reasonable that the force exerted by each hand is equal to half the weight of the pole, or 24.5 N. This obviously
satisfies the first condition for equilibrium              . The second condition             is also satisfied, as we can
see by choosing the cg to be the pivot point. The weight exerts no torque about a pivot point located at the cg, since
it is applied at that point and its lever arm is zero. The equal forces exerted by the hands are equidistant from the
chosen pivot, and so they exert equal and opposite torques. Similar arguments hold for other systems where
supporting forces are exerted symmetrically about the cg. For example, the four legs of a uniform table each support
one-fourth of its weight.

In Figure 9.18, a pole vaulter holding a pole with its cg halfway between his hands is shown. Each hand exerts a
force equal to half the weight of the pole,                   . (b) The pole vaulter moves the pole to his left, and the
forces that the hands exert are no longer equal. See Figure 9.18. If the pole is held with its cg to the left of the
person, then he must push down with his right hand and up with his left. The forces he exerts are larger here
because they are in opposite directions and the cg is at a long distance from either hand.

Similar observations can be made using a meter stick held at different locations along its length.




                              FIGURE 9.18 A pole vaulter holds a pole horizontally with both hands.

                 FIGURE 9.19 A pole vaulter is holding a pole horizontally with both hands. The center of gravity is near his right hand.




            FIGURE 9.20 A pole vaulter is holding a pole horizontally with both hands. The center of gravity is to the left side of the vaulter.

      If the pole vaulter holds the pole as shown in Figure 9.19, the situation is not as simple. The total force he exerts is
      still equal to the weight of the pole, but it is not evenly divided between his hands. (If               , then the torques
      about the cg would not be equal since the lever arms are different.) Logically, the right hand should support more
      weight, since it is closer to the cg. In fact, if the right hand is moved directly under the cg, it will support all the
      weight. This situation is exactly analogous to two people carrying a load; the one closer to the cg carries more of its
      weight. Finding the forces       and       is straightforward, as the next example shows.

      If the pole vaulter holds the pole from near the end of the pole (Figure 9.20), the direction of the force applied by the
      right hand of the vaulter reverses its direction.


              EXAMPLE 9.2

      What Force Is Needed to Support a Weight Held Near Its CG?
      For the situation shown in Figure 9.19, calculate: (a)  , the force exerted by the right hand, and (b)   , the force
      exerted by the left hand. The hands are 0.900 m apart, and the cg of the pole is 0.600 m from the left hand.

      Strategy

      Figure 9.19 includes a free body diagram for the pole, the system of interest. There is not enough information to use
      the first condition for equilibrium             ), since two of the three forces are unknown and the hand forces cannot
      be assumed to be equal in this case. There is enough information to use the second condition for equilibrium
                   if the pivot point is chosen to be at either hand, thereby making the torque from that hand zero. We
      choose to locate the pivot at the left hand in this part of the problem, to eliminate the torque from the left hand.

      Solution for (a)

      There are now only two nonzero torques, those from the gravitational force (                      ) and from the push or pull of the

right hand (   ). Stating the second condition in terms of clockwise and counterclockwise torques,
                                                                                                                      9.22
or the algebraic sum of the torques is zero.

Here this is
                                                                                                                      9.23
since the weight of the pole creates a counterclockwise torque and the right hand counters with a clockwise torque.
Using the definition of torque,            , noting that        , and substituting known values, we obtain
                                                                                                                      9.24
Thus,


                                                                                                                      9.25


Solution for (b)

The first condition for equilibrium is based on the free body diagram in the figure. This implies that by Newton’s
second law:
                                                                                                                      9.26
From this we can conclude:
                                                                                                                      9.27
Solving for    , we obtain



                                                                                                                      9.28



Discussion

    is seen to be exactly half of   , as we might have guessed, since       is applied twice as far from the cg as        .


If the pole vaulter holds the pole as he might at the start of a run, shown in Figure 9.20, the forces change again.
Both are considerably greater, and one force reverses direction.

      9.5 Simple Machines
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Describe different simple machines.
       • Calculate the mechanical advantage.

      Simple machines are devices that can be used to multiply or augment a force that we apply – often at the expense of
      a distance through which we apply the force. The word for “machine” comes from the Greek word meaning “to help
      make things easier.” Levers, gears, pulleys, wedges, and screws are some examples of machines. Energy is still
      conserved for these devices because a machine cannot do more work than the energy put into it. However,
      machines can reduce the input force that is needed to perform the job. The ratio of output to input force magnitudes
      for any simple machine is called its mechanical advantage (MA).

                                                                                                                                                 9.29

      One of the simplest machines is the lever, which is a rigid bar pivoted at a fixed place called the fulcrum. Torques are
      involved in levers, since there is rotation about a pivot point. Distances from the physical pivot of the lever are
      crucial, and we can obtain a useful expression for the MA in terms of these distances.




      FIGURE 9.21 A nail puller is a lever with a large mechanical advantage. The external forces on the nail puller are represented by solid
      arrows. The force that the nail puller applies to the nail ( ) is not a force on the nail puller. The reaction force the nail exerts back on the
      puller ( ) is an external force and is equal and opposite to      . The perpendicular lever arms of the input and output forces are and .

      Figure 9.21 shows a lever type that is used as a nail puller. Crowbars, seesaws, and other such levers are all
      analogous to this one.      is the input force and     is the output force. There are three vertical forces acting on the
      nail puller (the system of interest) – these are           and .      is the reaction force back on the system, equal and
      opposite to      . (Note that    is not a force on the system.) is the normal force upon the lever, and its torque is
      zero since it is exerted at the pivot. The torques due to      and     must be equal to each other if the nail is not
      moving, to satisfy the second condition for equilibrium                  . (In order for the nail to actually move, the torque
      due to     must be ever-so-slightly greater than torque due to        .) Hence,
                                                                                                                                                 9.30
      Notice that is the distance from the pivot point to the point where the input force     is applied, and    (not
      labeled on the diagram) is the distance from the pivot point to the point where the output force     is applied. The
      distances and are the perpendicular components of the distances from where the input and output forces are
      applied to the pivot, as shown in the figure. Rearranging the last equation gives

                                                                                                                                        9.31

What interests us most here is that the magnitude of the force exerted by the nail puller,   , is much greater than
the magnitude of the input force applied to the puller at the other end, . For the nail puller,

                                                                                                                                        9.32

This equation is true for levers in general. For the nail puller, the MA is certainly greater than one. The longer the
handle on the nail puller, the greater the force you can exert with it.

Two other types of levers that differ slightly from the nail puller are a wheelbarrow and a shovel, shown in Figure
9.22. All these lever types are similar in that only three forces are involved – the input force, the output force, and
the force on the pivot – and thus their MAs are given by                          and                , with distances being measured
relative to the physical pivot. The wheelbarrow and shovel differ from the nail puller because both the input and
output forces are on the same side of the pivot.

In the case of the wheelbarrow, the output force or load is between the pivot (the wheel’s axle) and the input or
applied force. In the case of the shovel, the input force is between the pivot (at the end of the handle) and the load,
but the input lever arm is shorter than the output lever arm. In this case, the MA is less than one.




FIGURE 9.22 (a) In the case of the wheelbarrow, the output force or load is between the pivot and the input force. The pivot is the wheel’s
axle. Here, the output force is greater than the input force. Thus, a wheelbarrow enables you to lift much heavier loads than you could with
your body alone. (b) In the case of the shovel, the input force is between the pivot and the load, but the input lever arm is shorter than the
output lever arm. The pivot is at the handle held by the right hand. Here, the output force (supporting the shovel’s load) is less than the
input force (from the hand nearest the load), because the input is exerted closer to the pivot than is the output.


        EXAMPLE 9.3

What is the Advantage for the Wheelbarrow?
In the wheelbarrow of Figure 9.22, the load has a perpendicular lever arm of 7.50 cm, while the hands have a
perpendicular lever arm of 1.02 m. (a) What upward force must you exert to support the wheelbarrow and its load if
their combined mass is 45.0 kg? (b) What force does the wheelbarrow exert on the ground?

      Strategy

      Here, we use the concept of mechanical advantage.

      Solution

      (a) In this case,            becomes


                                                                                                                         9.33

      Adding values into this equation yields

                                                                                                                         9.34

      The free-body diagram (see Figure 9.22) gives the following normal force:              . Therefore,
                                                   .    is the normal force acting on the wheel; by Newton’s third law, the
      force the wheel exerts on the ground is        .

      Discussion

      An even longer handle would reduce the force needed to lift the load. The MA here is                                 .


      Another very simple machine is the inclined plane. Pushing a cart up a plane is easier than lifting the same cart
      straight up to the top using a ladder, because the applied force is less. However, the work done in both cases
      (assuming the work done by friction is negligible) is the same. Inclined lanes or ramps were probably used during
      the construction of the Egyptian pyramids to move large blocks of stone to the top.

      A crank is a lever that can be rotated         about its pivot, as shown in Figure 9.23. Such a machine may not look like
      a lever, but the physics of its actions remain the same. The MA for a crank is simply the ratio of the radii     .
      Wheels and gears have this simple expression for their MAs too. The MA can be greater than 1, as it is for the crank,
      or less than 1, as it is for the simplified car axle driving the wheels, as shown. If the axle’s radius is    and the
      wheel’s radius is             , then                           and the axle would have to exert a force of         on
      the wheel to enable it to exert a force of            on the ground.

FIGURE 9.23 (a) A crank is a type of lever that can be rotated        about its pivot. Cranks are usually designed to have a large MA. (b) A
simplified automobile axle drives a wheel, which has a much larger diameter than the axle. The MA is less than 1. (c) An ordinary pulley is
used to lift a heavy load. The pulley changes the direction of the force exerted by the cord without changing its magnitude. Hence, this
machine has an MA of 1.

An ordinary pulley has an MA of 1; it only changes the direction of the force and not its magnitude. Combinations of
pulleys, such as those illustrated in Figure 9.24, are used to multiply force. If the pulleys are friction-free, then the
force output is approximately an integral multiple of the tension in the cable. The number of cables pulling directly
upward on the system of interest, as illustrated in the figures given below, is approximately the MA of the pulley
system. Since each attachment applies an external force in approximately the same direction as the others, they
add, producing a total force that is nearly an integral multiple of the input force .

      9.6 Forces and Torques in Muscles and Joints
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Explain the forces exerted by muscles.
       • State how a bad posture causes back strain.
       • Discuss the benefits of skeletal muscles attached close to joints.
       • Discuss various complexities in the real system of muscles, bones, and joints.

      Muscles, bones, and joints are some of the most interesting applications of statics. There are some surprises.
      Muscles, for example, exert far greater forces than we might think. Figure 9.25 shows a forearm holding a book and
      a schematic diagram of an analogous lever system. The schematic is a good approximation for the forearm, which
      looks more complicated than it is, and we can get some insight into the way typical muscle systems function by
      analyzing it.

      Muscles can only contract, so they occur in pairs. In the arm, the biceps muscle is a flexor—that is, it closes the limb.
      The triceps muscle is an extensor that opens the limb. This configuration is typical of skeletal muscles, bones, and
      joints in humans and other vertebrates. Most skeletal muscles exert much larger forces within the body than the
      limbs apply to the outside world. The reason is clear once we realize that most muscles are attached to bones via
      tendons close to joints, causing these systems to have mechanical advantages much less than one. Viewing them as
      simple machines, the input force is much greater than the output force, as seen in Figure 9.25.




      FIGURE 9.25 (a) The figure shows the forearm of a person holding a book. The biceps exert a force          to support the weight of the forearm

and the book. The triceps are assumed to be relaxed. (b) Here, you can view an approximately equivalent mechanical system with the pivot
at the elbow joint as seen in Example 9.4.


        EXAMPLE 9.4

Muscles Exert Bigger Forces Than You Might Think
Calculate the force the biceps muscle must exert to hold the forearm and its load as shown in Figure 9.25, and
compare this force with the weight of the forearm plus its load. You may take the data in the figure to be accurate to
three significant figures.

Strategy

There are four forces acting on the forearm and its load (the system of interest). The magnitude of the force of the
biceps is   ; that of the elbow joint is      ; that of the weights of the forearm is   , and its load is      . Two of these
are unknown (      and     ), so that the first condition for equilibrium cannot by itself yield     . But if we use the
second condition and choose the pivot to be at the elbow, then the torque due to            is zero, and the only unknown
becomes      .

Solution

The torques created by the weights are clockwise relative to the pivot, while the torque created by the biceps is
counterclockwise; thus, the second condition for equilibrium              becomes
                                                                                                                                 9.35
Note that           for all forces, since               for all forces. This equation can easily be solved for           in terms of
known quantities, yielding

                                                                                                                                 9.36

Entering the known values gives

                                                                                                                                 9.37

which yields
                                                                                                                                 9.38

Now, the combined weight of the arm and its load is                                               , so that the ratio of the force
exerted by the biceps to the total weight is

                                                                                                                                 9.39

Discussion

This means that the biceps muscle is exerting a force 7.38 times the weight supported.


In the above example of the biceps muscle, the angle between the forearm and upper arm is 90°. If this angle
changes, the force exerted by the biceps muscle also changes. In addition, the length of the biceps muscle changes.
The force the biceps muscle can exert depends upon its length; it is smaller when it is shorter than when it is
stretched.

Very large forces are also created in the joints. In the previous example, the downward force       exerted by the
humerus at the elbow joint equals 407 N, or 6.38 times the total weight supported. (The calculation of        is
straightforward and is left as an end-of-chapter problem.) Because muscles can contract, but not expand beyond
their resting length, joints and muscles often exert forces that act in opposite directions and thus subtract. (In the
above example, the upward force of the muscle minus the downward force of the joint equals the weight
supported—that is,                           , approximately equal to the weight supported.) Forces in muscles and
378   9 • Statics and Torque



      joints are largest when their load is a long distance from the joint, as the book is in the previous example.

      In racquet sports such as tennis the constant extension of the arm during game play creates large forces in this way.
      The mass times the lever arm of a tennis racquet is an important factor, and many players use the heaviest racquet
      they can handle. It is no wonder that joint deterioration and damage to the tendons in the elbow, such as “tennis
      elbow,” can result from repetitive motion, undue torques, and possibly poor racquet selection in such sports.
      Various tried techniques for holding and using a racquet or bat or stick not only increases sporting prowess but can
      minimize fatigue and long-term damage to the body. For example, tennis balls correctly hit at the “sweet spot” on
      the racquet will result in little vibration or impact force being felt in the racquet and the body—less torque as
      explained in Collisions of Extended Bodies in Two Dimensions. Twisting the hand to provide top spin on the ball or
      using an extended rigid elbow in a backhand stroke can also aggravate the tendons in the elbow.

      Training coaches and physical therapists use the knowledge of relationships between forces and torques in the
      treatment of muscles and joints. In physical therapy, an exercise routine can apply a particular force and torque
      which can, over a period of time, revive muscles and joints. Some exercises are designed to be carried out under
      water, because this requires greater forces to be exerted, further strengthening muscles. However, connecting
      tissues in the limbs, such as tendons and cartilage as well as joints are sometimes damaged by the large forces they
      carry. Often, this is due to accidents, but heavily muscled athletes, such as weightlifters, can tear muscles and
      connecting tissue through effort alone.

      The back is considerably more complicated than the arm or leg, with various muscles and joints between vertebrae,
      all having mechanical advantages less than 1. Back muscles must, therefore, exert very large forces, which are
      borne by the spinal column. Discs crushed by mere exertion are very common. The jaw is somewhat
      exceptional—the masseter muscles that close the jaw have a mechanical advantage greater than 1 for the back
      teeth, allowing us to exert very large forces with them. A cause of stress headaches is persistent clenching of teeth
      where the sustained large force translates into fatigue in muscles around the skull.

      Figure 9.26 shows how bad posture causes back strain. In part (a), we see a person with good posture. Note that her
      upper body’s cg is directly above the pivot point in the hips, which in turn is directly above the base of support at her
      feet. Because of this, her upper body’s weight exerts no torque about the hips. The only force needed is a vertical
      force at the hips equal to the weight supported. No muscle action is required, since the bones are rigid and transmit
      this force from the floor. This is a position of unstable equilibrium, but only small forces are needed to bring the
      upper body back to vertical if it is slightly displaced. Bad posture is shown in part (b); we see that the upper body’s
      cg is in front of the pivot in the hips. This creates a clockwise torque around the hips that is counteracted by muscles
      in the lower back. These muscles must exert large forces, since they have typically small mechanical advantages.
      (In other words, the perpendicular lever arm for the muscles is much smaller than for the cg.) Poor posture can also
      cause muscle strain for people sitting at their desks using computers. Special chairs are available that allow the
      body’s CG to be more easily situated above the seat, to reduce back pain. Prolonged muscle action produces muscle
      strain. Note that the cg of the entire body is still directly above the base of support in part (b) of Figure 9.26. This is
      compulsory; otherwise the person would not be in equilibrium. We lean forward for the same reason when carrying
      a load on our backs, to the side when carrying a load in one arm, and backward when carrying a load in front of us,
      as seen in Figure 9.27.

FIGURE 9.26 (a) Good posture places the upper body’s cg over the pivots in the hips, eliminating the need for muscle action to balance the
body. (b) Poor posture requires exertion by the back muscles to counteract the clockwise torque produced around the pivot by the upper
body’s weight. The back muscles have a small effective perpendicular lever arm,       , and must therefore exert a large force  . Note that
the legs lean backward to keep the cg of the entire body above the base of support in the feet.

You have probably been warned against lifting objects with your back. This action, even more than bad posture, can
cause muscle strain and damage discs and vertebrae, since abnormally large forces are created in the back muscles
and spine.

cg above the base of support at his feet. (b) A student carrying a shoulder bag leans to the side to keep the overall cg over their feet. (c)
Another student carrying a load of books in her arms leans backward for the same reason.


        EXAMPLE 9.5

Do Not Lift with Your Back
Consider the person lifting a heavy box with his back, shown in Figure 9.28. (a) Calculate the magnitude of the force
     in the back muscles that is needed to support the upper body plus the box and compare this with his weight.
The mass of the upper body is 55.0 kg and the mass of the box is 30.0 kg. (b) Calculate the magnitude and direction
of the force     exerted by the vertebrae on the spine at the indicated pivot point. Again, data in the figure may be
taken to be accurate to three significant figures.

Strategy

By now, we sense that the second condition for equilibrium is a good place to start, and inspection of the known
values confirms that it can be used to solve for     if the pivot is chosen to be at the hips. The torques created by
    and         are clockwise, while that created by        is counterclockwise.

      This force is considerably larger than it would be if the load were not present.

      More important in terms of its damage potential is the force on the vertebrae      . The first condition for equilibrium
      (           ) can be used to find its magnitude and direction. Using for vertical and for horizontal, the condition

      Starting with the vertical ( ) components, this yields

      Thus,

      Similarly, for the horizontal ( ) components,
                                                                                                                         9.47

      The magnitude of              is given by the Pythagorean theorem:

      Discussion

      This force is about 5.6 times greater than it would be if the person were standing erect. The trouble with the back is
      not so much that the forces are large—because similar forces are created in our hips, knees, and ankles—but that
      our spines are relatively weak. Proper lifting, performed with the back erect and using the legs to raise the body and

load, creates much smaller forces in the back—in this case, about 5.6 times smaller.




FIGURE 9.28 This figure shows that large forces are exerted by the back muscles and experienced in the vertebrae when a person lifts with
their back, since these muscles have small effective perpendicular lever arms. The data shown here are analyzed in the preceding example,
Example 9.5.

What are the benefits of having most skeletal muscles attached so close to joints? One advantage is speed because
small muscle contractions can produce large movements of limbs in a short period of time. Other advantages are
flexibility and agility, made possible by the large numbers of joints and the ranges over which they function. For
example, it is difficult to imagine a system with biceps muscles attached at the wrist that would be capable of the
broad range of movement we vertebrates possess.

There are some interesting complexities in real systems of muscles, bones, and joints. For instance, the pivot point
in many joints changes location as the joint is flexed, so that the perpendicular lever arms and the mechanical
advantage of the system change, too. Thus the force the biceps muscle must exert to hold up a book varies as the
forearm is flexed. Similar mechanisms operate in the legs, which explain, for example, why there is less leg strain
when a bicycle seat is set at the proper height. The methods employed in this section give a reasonable description
of real systems provided enough is known about the dimensions of the system. There are many other interesting
examples of force and torque in the body—a few of these are the subject of end-of-chapter problems.

INTRODUCTION TO ROTATIONAL MOTION AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM Why do tornadoes spin at all? And why
do tornados spin so rapidly? The answer is that air masses that produce tornadoes are themselves rotating, and
when the radii of the air masses decrease, their rate of rotation increases. An ice skater increases her spin in an
exactly analogous manner as seen in Figure 10.2. The skater starts her rotation with outstretched limbs and
increases her spin by pulling them in toward her body. The same physics describes the exhilarating spin of a skater
and the wrenching force of a tornado.

Clearly, force, energy, and power are associated with rotational motion. These and other aspects of rotational
motion are covered in this chapter. We shall see that all important aspects of rotational motion either have already
been defined for linear motion or have exact analogs in linear motion. First, we look at angular acceleration—the
rotational analog of linear acceleration.

       • Observe the link between linear and angular acceleration.

      Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation discussed only uniform circular motion, which is motion in a circle at
      constant speed and, hence, constant angular velocity. Recall that angular velocity was defined as the time rate of
      change of angle :

Angular velocity is not constant when a skater pulls in her arms, when a child starts up a merry-go-round from rest,
or when a computer’s hard disk slows to a halt when switched off. In all these cases, there is an angular
acceleration, in which changes. The faster the change occurs, the greater the angular acceleration. Angular
acceleration is defined as the rate of change of angular velocity. In equation form, angular acceleration is
expressed as follows:

                                                                                                                  10.4

where      is the change in angular velocity and    is the change in time. The units of angular acceleration are
        , or       . If increases, then is positive. If decreases, then is negative.


        EXAMPLE 10.1

Calculating the Angular Acceleration and Deceleration of a Bike Wheel
Suppose a teenager puts her bicycle on its back and starts the rear wheel spinning from rest to a final angular
velocity of 250 rpm in 5.00 s. (a) Calculate the angular acceleration in       . (b) If she now slams on the brakes,
causing an angular acceleration of                , how long does it take the wheel to stop?

Strategy for (a)

The angular acceleration can be found directly from its definition in         because the final angular velocity and
time are given. We see that     is 250 rpm and      is 5.00 s.

Solution for (a)

Entering known information into the definition of angular acceleration, we get


                                                                                                                  10.5


Because     is in revolutions per minute (rpm) and we want the standard units of           for angular acceleration, we
need to convert     from rpm to rad/s:


                                                                                                                  10.6


Entering this quantity into the expression for , we get



                                                                                                                  10.7



Strategy for (b)

In this part, we know the angular acceleration and the initial angular velocity. We can find the stoppage time by
using the definition of angular acceleration and solving for , yielding

                                                                                                                  10.8

Solution for (b)

Here the angular velocity decreases from              (250 rpm) to zero, so that     is            , and   is given to
be              . Thus,

      Discussion

      Note that the angular acceleration as the girl spins the wheel is small and positive; it takes 5 s to produce an
      appreciable angular velocity. When she hits the brake, the angular acceleration is large and negative. The angular
      velocity quickly goes to zero. In both cases, the relationships are analogous to what happens with linear motion. For
      example, there is a large deceleration when you crash into a brick wall—the velocity change is large in a short time
      interval.


      If the bicycle in the preceding example had been on its wheels instead of upside-down, it would first have
      accelerated along the ground and then come to a stop. This connection between circular motion and linear motion
      needs to be explored. For example, it would be useful to know how linear and angular acceleration are related. In
      circular motion, linear acceleration is tangent to the circle at the point of interest, as seen in Figure 10.4. Thus, linear
      acceleration is called tangential acceleration .




      FIGURE 10.4 In circular motion, linear acceleration , occurs as the magnitude of the velocity changes:      is tangent to the motion. In the
      context of circular motion, linear acceleration is also called tangential acceleration .

      Linear or tangential acceleration refers to changes in the magnitude of velocity but not its direction. We know from
      Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation that in circular motion centripetal acceleration, , refers to changes in the
      direction of the velocity but not its magnitude. An object undergoing circular motion experiences centripetal
      acceleration, as seen in Figure 10.5. Thus, and        are perpendicular and independent of one another. Tangential
      acceleration is directly related to the angular acceleration and is linked to an increase or decrease in the
      velocity, but not its direction.




      FIGURE 10.5 Centripetal acceleration     occurs as the direction of velocity changes; it is perpendicular to the circular motion. Centripetal
      and tangential acceleration are thus perpendicular to each other.

      Now we can find the exact relationship between linear acceleration and angular acceleration . Because linear
      acceleration is proportional to a change in the magnitude of the velocity, it is defined (as it was in One-Dimensional

For circular motion, note that           , so that

The radius is constant for circular motion, and so                          . Thus,

                                                                                                                             10.13

These equations mean that linear acceleration and angular acceleration are directly proportional. The greater the
angular acceleration is, the larger the linear (tangential) acceleration is, and vice versa. For example, the greater the
angular acceleration of a car’s drive wheels, the greater the acceleration of the car. The radius also matters. For
example, the smaller a wheel, the smaller its linear acceleration for a given angular acceleration .

Calculating the Angular Acceleration of a Motorcycle Wheel
A powerful motorcycle can accelerate from 0 to 30.0 m/s (about 108 km/h) in 4.20 s. What is the angular
acceleration of its 0.320-m-radius wheels? (See Figure 10.6.)




             FIGURE 10.6 The linear acceleration of a motorcycle is accompanied by an angular acceleration of its wheels.

Strategy

We are given information about the linear velocities of the motorcycle. Thus, we can find its linear acceleration                 .
Then, the expression        can be used to find the angular acceleration.

Solution
The linear acceleration is

      Discussion

      Units of radians are dimensionless and appear in any relationship between angular and linear quantities.


      So far, we have defined three rotational quantities—     , and . These quantities are analogous to the translational
      quantities     , and . Table 10.1 displays rotational quantities, the analogous translational quantities, and the
      relationships between them.

        Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment
        Sit down with your feet on the ground on a chair that rotates. Lift one of your legs such that it is unbent
        (straightened out). Using the other leg, begin to rotate yourself by pushing on the ground. Stop using your leg to
        push the ground but allow the chair to rotate. From the origin where you began, sketch the angle, angular
        velocity, and angular acceleration of your leg as a function of time in the form of three separate graphs. Estimate
        the magnitudes of these quantities.


           CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
      Angular acceleration is a vector, having both magnitude and direction. How do we denote its magnitude and
      direction? Illustrate with an example.
      Solution
      The magnitude of angular acceleration is and its most common units are                . The direction of angular
      acceleration along a fixed axis is denoted by a + or a – sign, just as the direction of linear acceleration in one
      dimension is denoted by a + or a – sign. For example, consider a gymnast doing a forward flip. Her angular
      momentum would be parallel to the mat and to her left. The magnitude of her angular acceleration would be
      proportional to her angular velocity (spin rate) and her moment of inertia about her spin axis.

10.2 Kinematics of Rotational Motion
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Observe the kinematics of rotational motion.
 • Derive rotational kinematic equations.
 • Evaluate problem solving strategies for rotational kinematics.

Just by using our intuition, we can begin to see how rotational quantities like , , and are related to one another.
For example, if a motorcycle wheel has a large angular acceleration for a fairly long time, it ends up spinning rapidly
and rotates through many revolutions. In more technical terms, if the wheel’s angular acceleration is large for a
long period of time , then the final angular velocity and angle of rotation are large. The wheel’s rotational
motion is exactly analogous to the fact that the motorcycle’s large translational acceleration produces a large final
velocity, and the distance traveled will also be large.

Kinematics is the description of motion. The kinematics of rotational motion describes the relationships among
rotation angle, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and time. Let us start by finding an equation relating , , and
 . To determine this equation, we recall a familiar kinematic equation for translational, or straight-line, motion:
                                                                                                                 10.17
Note that in rotational motion          , and we shall use the symbol for tangential or linear acceleration from now
on. As in linear kinematics, we assume is constant, which means that angular acceleration is also a constant,
because           . Now, let us substitute        and          into the linear equation above:
                                                                                                                 10.18
The radius cancels in the equation, yielding
                                                                                                                 10.19
where     is the initial angular velocity. This last equation is a kinematic relationship among , , and —that is, it
describes their relationship without reference to forces or masses that may affect rotation. It is also precisely
analogous in form to its translational counterpart.


 Making Connections
 Kinematics for rotational motion is completely analogous to translational kinematics, first presented in One-
 Dimensional Kinematics. Kinematics is concerned with the description of motion without regard to force or
 mass. We will find that translational kinematic quantities, such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration have
 direct analogs in rotational motion.


Starting with the four kinematic equations we developed in One-Dimensional Kinematics, we can derive the
following four rotational kinematic equations (presented together with their translational counterparts):

                                                                         (constant , )


                                                                         (constant , )


                                                                         (constant , )

                              TABLE 10.2 Rotational Kinematic Equations
398   10 • Rotational Motion and Angular Momentum



      In these equations, the subscript 0 denotes initial values ( ,     , and   are initial values), and the average angular
      velocity and average velocity are defined as follows:

                                                                                                                        10.20

      The equations given above in Table 10.2 can be used to solve any rotational or translational kinematics problem in
      which and are constant.


        Problem-Solving Strategy for Rotational Kinematics
        1. Examine the situation to determine that rotational kinematics (rotational motion) is involved. Rotation must
           be involved, but without the need to consider forces or masses that affect the motion.
        2. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A sketch of the
           situation is useful.
        3. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).
        4. Solve the appropriate equation or equations for the quantity to be determined (the unknown). It can be
           useful to think in terms of a translational analog because by now you are familiar with such motion.
        5. Substitute the known values along with their units into the appropriate equation, and obtain numerical
           solutions complete with units. Be sure to use units of radians for angles.
        6. Check your answer to see if it is reasonable: Does your answer make sense?



              EXAMPLE 10.3

      Calculating the Acceleration of a Fishing Reel
      A deep-sea fisherman hooks a big fish that swims away from the boat pulling the fishing line from his fishing reel.
      The whole system is initially at rest and the fishing line unwinds from the reel at a radius of 4.50 cm from its axis of
      rotation. The reel is given an angular acceleration of            for 2.00 s as seen in Figure 10.7.

      (a) What is the final angular velocity of the reel?

      (b) At what speed is fishing line leaving the reel after 2.00 s elapses?

      (c) How many revolutions does the reel make?

      (d) How many meters of fishing line come off the reel in this time?

      Strategy

      In each part of this example, the strategy is the same as it was for solving problems in linear kinematics. In
      particular, known values are identified and a relationship is then sought that can be used to solve for the unknown.

      Solution for (a)

      Here and are given and needs to be determined. The most straightforward equation to use is
      because the unknown is already on one side and all other terms are known. That equation states that
                                                                                                                        10.21
      We are also given that            (it starts from rest), so that

                                                                                                                        10.22

      Now that     is known, the speed     can most easily be found using the relationship

                                                                                                                               10.24
Note again that radians must always be used in any calculation relating linear and angular quantities. Also, because
radians are dimensionless, we have               .

Solution for (c)

Here, we are asked to find the number of revolutions. Because                              , we can find the number of
revolutions by finding in radians. We are given and , and we know                     is zero, so that can be obtained using
                   .


                                                                                                                               10.25


Converting radians to revolutions gives

                                                                                                                               10.26

Solution for (d)

The number of meters of fishing line is , which can be obtained through its relationship with :
                                                                                                                               10.27

Discussion

This example illustrates that relationships among rotational quantities are highly analogous to those among linear
quantities. We also see in this example how linear and rotational quantities are connected. The answers to the
questions are realistic. After unwinding for two seconds, the reel is found to spin at 220 rad/s, which is 2100 rpm.
(No wonder reels sometimes make high-pitched sounds.) The amount of fishing line played out is 9.90 m, about
right for when the big fish bites.




FIGURE 10.7 Fishing line coming off a rotating reel moves linearly. Example 10.3 and Example 10.4 consider relationships between
rotational and linear quantities associated with a fishing reel.


        EXAMPLE 10.4

Calculating the Duration When the Fishing Reel Slows Down and Stops
Now let us consider what happens if the fisherman applies a brake to the spinning reel, achieving an angular
acceleration of            . How long does it take the reel to come to a stop?

Strategy

We are asked to find the time for the reel to come to a stop. The initial and final conditions are different from those
in the previous problem, which involved the same fishing reel. Now we see that the initial angular velocity is
                 and the final angular velocity is zero. The angular acceleration is given to be                    .

      Examining the available equations, we see all quantities but t are known in                 making it easiest to use
      this equation.

      Solution

      The equation states
                                                                                                                      10.28
      We solve the equation algebraically for t, and then substitute the known values as usual, yielding

                                                                                                                      10.29

      Discussion

      Note that care must be taken with the signs that indicate the directions of various quantities. Also, note that the time
      to stop the reel is fairly small because the acceleration is rather large. Fishing lines sometimes snap because of the
      accelerations involved, and fishermen often let the fish swim for a while before applying brakes on the reel. A tired
      fish will be slower, requiring a smaller acceleration.



              EXAMPLE 10.5

      Calculating the Slow Acceleration of Trains and Their Wheels
      Large freight trains accelerate very slowly. Suppose one such train accelerates from rest, giving its 0.350-m-radius
      wheels an angular acceleration of               . After the wheels have made 200 revolutions (assume no slippage):
      (a) How far has the train moved down the track? (b) What are the final angular velocity of the wheels and the linear
      velocity of the train?

      Strategy

      In part (a), we are asked to find , and in (b) we are asked to find   and . We are given the number of revolutions ,
      the radius of the wheels , and the angular acceleration .

      Solution for (a)

      The distance     is very easily found from the relationship between distance and rotation angle:

                                                                                                                      10.30

      Solving this equation for    yields
                                                                                                                      10.31
      Before using this equation, we must convert the number of revolutions into radians, because we are dealing with a
      relationship between linear and rotational quantities:

                                                                                                                      10.32

      Now we can substitute the known values into            to find the distance the train moved down the track:
                                                                                                                      10.33

      Solution for (b)

      We cannot use any equation that incorporates to find , because the equation would have at least two unknown
      values. The equation                  will work, because we know the values for all variables except :

                                                                                                                      10.34

We can find the linear velocity of the train, , through its relationship to          :
                                                                                                                                  10.36

Discussion

The distance traveled is fairly large and the final velocity is fairly slow (just under 32 km/h).


There is translational motion even for something spinning in place, as the following example illustrates. Figure 10.8
shows a fly on the edge of a rotating microwave oven plate. The example below calculates the total distance it
travels.




        FIGURE 10.8 The image shows a microwave plate. The fly makes revolutions while the food is heated (along with the fly).


       EXAMPLE 10.6

Calculating the Distance Traveled by a Fly on the Edge of a Microwave Oven Plate
A person decides to use a microwave oven to reheat some lunch. In the process, a fly accidentally flies into the
microwave and lands on the outer edge of the rotating plate and remains there. If the plate has a radius of 0.15 m
and rotates at 6.0 rpm, calculate the total distance traveled by the fly during a 2.0-min cooking period. (Ignore the
start-up and slow-down times.)

Strategy

First, find the total number of revolutions , and then the linear distance               traveled.        can be used to find
because is given to be 6.0 rpm.

Solution

Entering known values into              gives

                                                                                                                                  10.37

As always, it is necessary to convert revolutions to radians before calculating a linear quantity like              from an angular
quantity like :

                                                                                                                                  10.38

Now, using the relationship between         and , we can determine the distance traveled:
                                                                                                                                  10.39
402   10 • Rotational Motion and Angular Momentum



      Discussion

      Quite a trip (if it survives)! Note that this distance is the total distance traveled by the fly. Displacement is actually
      zero for complete revolutions because they bring the fly back to its original position. The distinction between total
      distance traveled and displacement was first noted in One-Dimensional Kinematics.


           CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
      Rotational kinematics has many useful relationships, often expressed in equation form. Are these relationships laws
      of physics or are they simply descriptive? (Hint: the same question applies to linear kinematics.)
      Solution
      Rotational kinematics (just like linear kinematics) is descriptive and does not represent laws of nature. With
      kinematics, we can describe many things to great precision but kinematics does not consider causes. For example, a
      large angular acceleration describes a very rapid change in angular velocity without any consideration of its cause.


      10.3 Dynamics of Rotational Motion: Rotational Inertia
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Understand the relationship between force, mass and acceleration.
       • Study the turning effect of force.
       • Study the analogy between force and torque, mass and moment of inertia, and linear acceleration and
          angular acceleration.

      If you have ever spun a bike wheel or pushed a merry-go-round, you know that force is needed to change angular
      velocity as seen in Figure 10.9. In fact, your intuition is reliable in predicting many of the factors that are involved.
      For example, we know that a door opens slowly if we push too close to its hinges. Furthermore, we know that the
      more massive the door, the more slowly it opens. The first example implies that the farther the force is applied from
      the pivot, the greater the angular acceleration; another implication is that angular acceleration is inversely
      proportional to mass. These relationships should seem very similar to the familiar relationships among force, mass,
      and acceleration embodied in Newton’s second law of motion. There are, in fact, precise rotational analogs to both
      force and mass.




      FIGURE 10.9 Force is required to spin the bike wheel. The greater the force, the greater the angular acceleration produced. The more
      massive the wheel, the smaller the angular acceleration. If you push on a spoke closer to the axle, the angular acceleration will be smaller.

      To develop the precise relationship among force, mass, radius, and angular acceleration, consider what happens if
      we exert a force on a point mass that is at a distance from a pivot point, as shown in Figure 10.10. Because
      the force is perpendicular to , an acceleration      is obtained in the direction of . We can rearrange this
      equation such that        and then look for ways to relate this expression to expressions for rotational quantities.
      We note that       , and we substitute this expression into        , yielding
                                                                                                                                           10.40
      Recall that torque is the turning effectiveness of a force. In this case, because is perpendicular to , torque is
      simply         . So, if we multiply both sides of the equation above by , we get torque on the left-hand side. That is,

This last equation is the rotational analog of Newton’s second law (          ), where torque is analogous to force,
angular acceleration is analogous to translational acceleration, and      is analogous to mass (or inertia). The
quantity      is called the rotational inertia or moment of inertia of a point mass a distance from the center of
rotation.




FIGURE 10.10 An object is supported by a horizontal frictionless table and is attached to a pivot point by a cord that supplies centripetal
force. A force is applied to the object perpendicular to the radius , causing it to accelerate about the pivot point. The force is kept
perpendicular to .


  Making Connections: Rotational Motion Dynamics
  Dynamics for rotational motion is completely analogous to linear or translational dynamics. Dynamics is
  concerned with force and mass and their effects on motion. For rotational motion, we will find direct analogs to
  force and mass that behave just as we would expect from our earlier experiences.


Rotational Inertia and Moment of Inertia
Before we can consider the rotation of anything other than a point mass like the one in Figure 10.10, we must
extend the idea of rotational inertia to all types of objects. To expand our concept of rotational inertia, we define the
moment of inertia of an object to be the sum of            for all the point masses of which it is composed. That is,
             . Here is analogous to in translational motion. Because of the distance , the moment of inertia for
any object depends on the chosen axis. Actually, calculating is beyond the scope of this text except for one simple
case—that of a hoop, which has all its mass at the same distance from its axis. A hoop’s moment of inertia around its
axis is therefore      , where     is its total mass and its radius. (We use        and for an entire object to
distinguish them from and for point masses.) In all other cases, we must consult Figure 10.11 (note that the
table is piece of artwork that has shapes as well as formulae) for formulas for that have been derived from
integration over the continuous body. Note that has units of mass multiplied by distance squared (               ), as we
might expect from its definition.

The general relationship among torque, moment of inertia, and angular acceleration is
                                                                                                                                     10.43
or

                                                                                                                                     10.44

where net is the total torque from all forces relative to a chosen axis. For simplicity, we will only consider torques
exerted by forces in the plane of the rotation. Such torques are either positive or negative and add like ordinary
numbers. The relationship in                      is the rotational analog to Newton’s second law and is very generally
applicable. This equation is actually valid for any torque, applied to any object, relative to any axis.

As we might expect, the larger the torque is, the larger the angular acceleration is. For example, the harder a child
404   10 • Rotational Motion and Angular Momentum



      pushes on a merry-go-round, the faster it accelerates. Furthermore, the more massive a merry-go-round, the slower
      it accelerates for the same torque. The basic relationship between moment of inertia and angular acceleration is
      that the larger the moment of inertia, the smaller is the angular acceleration. But there is an additional twist. The
      moment of inertia depends not only on the mass of an object, but also on its distribution of mass relative to the axis
      around which it rotates. For example, it will be much easier to accelerate a merry-go-round full of children if they
      stand close to its axis than if they all stand at the outer edge. The mass is the same in both cases, but the moment of
      inertia is much larger when the children are at the edge.


        Take-Home Experiment
        Cut out a circle that has about a 10 cm radius from stiff cardboard. Near the edge of the circle, write numbers 1
        to 12 like hours on a clock face. Position the circle so that it can rotate freely about a horizontal axis through its
        center, like a wheel. (You could loosely nail the circle to a wall.) Hold the circle stationary and with the number
        12 positioned at the top, attach a lump of blue putty (sticky material used for fixing posters to walls) at the
        number 3. How large does the lump need to be to just rotate the circle? Describe how you can change the
        moment of inertia of the circle. How does this change affect the amount of blue putty needed at the number 3 to
        just rotate the circle? Change the circle’s moment of inertia and then try rotating the circle by using different
        amounts of blue putty. Repeat this process several times.



        Problem-Solving Strategy for Rotational Dynamics
        1. Examine the situation to determine that torque and mass are involved in the rotation. Draw a careful sketch
           of the situation.
        2. Determine the system of interest.
        3. Draw a free body diagram. That is, draw and label all external forces acting on the system of interest.
        4. Apply                       , the rotational equivalent of Newton’s second law, to solve the problem. Care
           must be taken to use the correct moment of inertia and to consider the torque about the point of rotation.
        5. As always, check the solution to see if it is reasonable.



        Making Connections
        In statics, the net torque is zero, and there is no angular acceleration. In rotational motion, net torque is the
        cause of angular acceleration, exactly as in Newton’s second law of motion for rotation.

Calculating the Effect of Mass Distribution on a Merry-Go-Round
Consider the father pushing a playground merry-go-round in Figure 10.12. He exerts a force of 250 N at the edge of
the 50.0-kg merry-go-round, which has a 1.50 m radius. Calculate the angular acceleration produced (a) when no
one is on the merry-go-round and (b) when an 18.0-kg child sits 1.25 m away from the center. Consider the merry-
go-round itself to be a uniform disk with negligible retarding friction.
406   10 • Rotational Motion and Angular Momentum




         FIGURE 10.12 A father pushes a playground merry-go-round at its edge and perpendicular to its radius to achieve maximum torque.

      Strategy

      Angular acceleration is given directly by the expression                   :

                                                                                                                                  10.45

      To solve for , we must first calculate the torque (which is the same in both cases) and moment of inertia (which
      is greater in the second case). To find the torque, we note that the applied force is perpendicular to the radius and
      friction is negligible, so that
                                                                                                                                  10.46

      Solution for (a)

      The moment of inertia of a solid disk about this axis is given in Figure 10.11 to be

                                                                                                                                  10.47

      where                  and                , so that

                                                                                                                                  10.48

      Now, after we substitute the known values, we find the angular acceleration to be

                                                                                                                                  10.49

      Solution for (b)

      We expect the angular acceleration for the system to be less in this part, because the moment of inertia is greater
      when the child is on the merry-go-round. To find the total moment of inertia , we first find the child’s moment of
      inertia  by considering the child to be equivalent to a point mass at a distance of 1.25 m from the axis. Then,

                                                                                                                                  10.50

      The total moment of inertia is the sum of moments of inertia of the merry-go-round and the child (about the same
      axis). To justify this sum to yourself, examine the definition of :

                                                                                                                                  10.51

      Substituting known values into the equation for         gives

                                                                                                                                  10.52

      Discussion

      The angular acceleration is less when the child is on the merry-go-round than when the merry-go-round is empty, as
      expected. The angular accelerations found are quite large, partly due to the fact that friction was considered to be

negligible. If, for example, the father kept pushing perpendicularly for 2.00 s, he would give the merry-go-round an
angular velocity of 13.3 rad/s when it is empty but only 8.89 rad/s when the child is on it. In terms of revolutions per
second, these angular velocities are 2.12 rev/s and 1.41 rev/s, respectively. The father would end up running at
about 50 km/h in the first case. Summer Olympics, here he comes! Confirmation of these numbers is left as an
exercise for the reader.


     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Torque is the analog of force and moment of inertia is the analog of mass. Force and mass are physical quantities
that depend on only one factor. For example, mass is related solely to the numbers of atoms of various types in an
object. Are torque and moment of inertia similarly simple?
Solution
No. Torque depends on three factors: force magnitude, force direction, and point of application. Moment of inertia
depends on both mass and its distribution relative to the axis of rotation. So, while the analogies are precise, these
rotational quantities depend on more factors.


10.4 Rotational Kinetic Energy: Work and Energy Revisited
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Derive the equation for rotational work.
 • Calculate rotational kinetic energy.
 • Demonstrate the Law of Conservation of Energy.

In this module, we will learn about work and energy associated with rotational motion. Figure 10.13 shows a worker
using an electric grindstone propelled by a motor. Sparks are flying, and noise and vibration are created as layers of
steel are pared from the pole. The stone continues to turn even after the motor is turned off, but it is eventually
brought to a stop by friction. Clearly, the motor had to work to get the stone spinning. This work went into heat, light,
sound, vibration, and considerable rotational kinetic energy.




FIGURE 10.13 The motor works in spinning the grindstone, giving it rotational kinetic energy. That energy is then converted to heat, light,
sound, and vibration. (credit: U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Zachary David Bell)

Work must be done to rotate objects such as grindstones or merry-go-rounds. Work was defined in Uniform Circular
Motion and Gravitation for translational motion, and we can build on that knowledge when considering work done in
rotational motion. The simplest rotational situation is one in which the net force is exerted perpendicular to the
radius of a disk (as shown in Figure 10.14) and remains perpendicular as the disk starts to rotate. The force is
parallel to the displacement, and so the net work done is the product of the force times the arc length traveled:
                                                                                                                                    10.53
To get torque and other rotational quantities into the equation, we multiply and divide the right-hand side of the
equation by , and gather terms:

                                                                                                                                    10.54

We recognize that                         and             , so that

                                                                                                                                          10.55
      This equation is the expression for rotational work. It is very similar to the familiar definition of translational work as
      force multiplied by distance. Here, torque is analogous to force, and angle is analogous to distance. The equation
                         is valid in general, even though it was derived for a special case.

      To get an expression for rotational kinetic energy, we must again perform some algebraic manipulations. The first
      step is to note that           , so that
                                                                                                                                          10.56




      FIGURE 10.14 The net force on this disk is kept perpendicular to its radius as the force causes the disk to rotate. The net work done is thus
              . The net work goes into rotational kinetic energy.


        Making Connections
        Work and energy in rotational motion are completely analogous to work and energy in translational motion, first
        presented in Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation.


      Now, we solve one of the rotational kinematics equations for                 . We start with the equation

                                                                                                                                          10.57

      Next, we solve for       :

                                                                                                                                          10.58

      Substituting this into the equation for net           and gathering terms yields

                                                                                                                                          10.59

      This equation is the work-energy theorem for rotational motion only. As you may recall, net work changes the
      kinetic energy of a system. Through an analogy with translational motion, we define the term         to be
      rotational kinetic energy               for an object with a moment of inertia          and an angular velocity        :

                                                                                                                                          10.60

      The expression for rotational kinetic energy is exactly analogous to translational kinetic energy, with being
      analogous to and to . Rotational kinetic energy has important effects. Flywheels, for example, can be used to
      store large amounts of rotational kinetic energy in a vehicle, as seen in Figure 10.15.

FIGURE 10.15 Experimental vehicles, such as this bus, have been constructed in which rotational kinetic energy is stored in a large
flywheel. When the bus goes down a hill, its transmission converts its gravitational potential energy into    . It can also convert
translational kinetic energy, when the bus stops, into     . The flywheel’s energy can then be used to accelerate, to go up another hill, or
to keep the bus from slowing down due to friction.


        EXAMPLE 10.8

Calculating the Work and Energy for Spinning a Grindstone
Consider a person who spins a large grindstone by placing her hand on its edge and exerting a force through part of
a revolution as shown in Figure 10.16. In this example, we verify that the work done by the torque she exerts equals
the change in rotational energy. (a) How much work is done if she exerts a force of 200 N through a rotation of
                  ? The force is kept perpendicular to the grindstone’s 0.320-m radius at the point of application, and
the effects of friction are negligible. (b) What is the final angular velocity if the grindstone has a mass of 85.0 kg? (c)
What is the final rotational kinetic energy? (It should equal the work.)

Strategy

To find the work, we can use the equation                     . We have enough information to calculate the torque
and are given the rotation angle. In the second part, we can find the final angular velocity using one of the kinematic
relationships. In the last part, we can calculate the rotational kinetic energy from its expression in               .

Solution for (a)

The net work is expressed in the equation
                                                                                                                                    10.61

      Solution for (b)

      To find from the given information requires more than one step. We start with the kinematic relationship in the
      equation

                                                                                                                         10.64

      Note that           because we start from rest. Taking the square root of the resulting equation gives

                                                                                                                         10.65

      Now we need to find . One possibility is

                                                                                                                         10.66

      The formula for the moment of inertia for a disk is found in Figure 10.11:

                                                                                                                         10.68

      Substituting the values of torque and moment of inertia into the expression for , we obtain

      Discussion

      The final rotational kinetic energy equals the work done by the torque, which confirms that the work done went into
      rotational kinetic energy. We could, in fact, have used an expression for energy instead of a kinematic relation to
      solve part (b). We will do this in later examples.


      Helicopter pilots are quite familiar with rotational kinetic energy. They know, for example, that a point of no return
      will be reached if they allow their blades to slow below a critical angular velocity during flight. The blades lose lift,
      and it is impossible to immediately get the blades spinning fast enough to regain it. Rotational kinetic energy must
      be supplied to the blades to get them to rotate faster, and enough energy cannot be supplied in time to avoid a
      crash. Because of weight limitations, helicopter engines are too small to supply both the energy needed for lift and
      to replenish the rotational kinetic energy of the blades once they have slowed down. The rotational kinetic energy is
      put into them before takeoff and must not be allowed to drop below this crucial level. One possible way to avoid a
      crash is to use the gravitational potential energy of the helicopter to replenish the rotational kinetic energy of the
      blades by losing altitude and aligning the blades so that the helicopter is spun up in the descent. Of course, if the
      helicopter’s altitude is too low, then there is insufficient time for the blade to regain lift before reaching the ground.

       EXAMPLE 10.9

Calculating Helicopter Energies
A typical small rescue helicopter, similar to the one in Figure 10.17, has four blades, each is 4.00 m long and has a
mass of 50.0 kg. The blades can be approximated as thin rods that rotate about one end of an axis perpendicular to
their length. The helicopter has a total loaded mass of 1000 kg. (a) Calculate the rotational kinetic energy in the
blades when they rotate at 300 rpm. (b) Calculate the translational kinetic energy of the helicopter when it flies at
20.0 m/s, and compare it with the rotational energy in the blades. (c) To what height could the helicopter be raised if
all of the rotational kinetic energy could be used to lift it?

Strategy

Rotational and translational kinetic energies can be calculated from their definitions. The last part of the problem
relates to the idea that energy can change form, in this case from rotational kinetic energy to gravitational potential
energy.

Solution for (a)

The rotational kinetic energy is

                                                                                                                    10.73

We must convert the angular velocity to radians per second and calculate the moment of inertia before we can find
    . The angular velocity is

                                                                                                                    10.74

The moment of inertia of one blade will be that of a thin rod rotated about its end, found in Figure 10.11. The total
is four times this moment of inertia, because there are four blades. Thus,

                                                                                                                    10.75

Entering   and     into the expression for rotational kinetic energy gives


                                                                                                                    10.76


Solution for (b)

Translational kinetic energy was defined in Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation. Entering the given values of
mass and velocity, we obtain

                                                                                                                                       10.77

      To compare kinetic energies, we take the ratio of translational kinetic energy to rotational kinetic energy. This ratio is

                                                                                                                                       10.78

      Solution for (c)

      At the maximum height, all rotational kinetic energy will have been converted to gravitational energy. To find this
      height, we equate those two energies:

                                                                                                                                       10.79

      or

                                                                                                                                       10.80

      We now solve for       and substitute known values into the resulting equation


                                                                                                                                       10.81


      Discussion

      The ratio of translational energy to rotational kinetic energy is only 0.380. This ratio tells us that most of the kinetic
      energy of the helicopter is in its spinning blades—something you probably would not suspect. The 53.7 m height to
      which the helicopter could be raised with the rotational kinetic energy is also impressive, again emphasizing the
      amount of rotational kinetic energy in the blades.




      FIGURE 10.17 The first image shows how helicopters store large amounts of rotational kinetic energy in their blades. This energy must be
      put into the blades before takeoff and maintained until the end of the flight. The engines do not have enough power to simultaneously
      provide lift and put significant rotational energy into the blades. The second image shows a helicopter from the Auckland Westpac Rescue
      Helicopter Service. Over 50,000 lives have been saved since its operations beginning in 1973. Here, a water rescue operation is shown.

  Making Connections
  Conservation of energy includes rotational motion, because rotational kinetic energy is another form of                            .
  Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation has a detailed treatment of conservation of energy.


How Thick Is the Soup? Or Why Don’t All Objects Roll Downhill at the Same Rate?
One of the quality controls in a tomato soup factory consists of rolling filled cans down a ramp. If they roll too fast,
the soup is too thin. Why should cans of identical size and mass roll down an incline at different rates? And why
should the thickest soup roll the slowest?

The easiest way to answer these questions is to consider energy. Suppose each can starts down the ramp from rest.
Each can starting from rest means each starts with the same gravitational potential energy      , which is
converted entirely to     , provided each rolls without slipping.    , however, can take the form of             or       ,
and total     is the sum of the two. If a can rolls down a ramp, it puts part of its energy into rotation, leaving less for
translation. Thus, the can goes slower than it would if it slid down. Furthermore, the thin soup does not rotate,
whereas the thick soup does, because it sticks to the can. The thick soup thus puts more of the can’s original
gravitational potential energy into rotation than the thin soup, and the can rolls more slowly, as seen in Figure 10.18.




FIGURE 10.18 Three cans of soup with identical masses race down an incline. The first can has a low friction coating and does not roll but
just slides down the incline. It wins because it converts its entire PE into translational KE. The second and third cans both roll down the
incline without slipping. The second can contains thin soup and comes in second because part of its initial PE goes into rotating the can (but
not the thin soup). The third can contains thick soup. It comes in third because the soup rotates along with the can, taking even more of the
initial PE for rotational KE, leaving less for translational KE.

Assuming no losses due to friction, there is only one force doing work—gravity. Therefore the total work done is the
change in kinetic energy. As the cans start moving, the potential energy is changing into kinetic energy. Conservation
of energy gives
                                                                                                                                     10.82
More specifically,

                                                                                                                                     10.83

or

                                                                                                                                     10.84

So, the initial     is divided between translational kinetic energy and rotational kinetic energy; and the greater is,
the less energy goes into translation. If the can slides down without friction, then        and all the energy goes into
translation; thus, the can goes faster.


  Take-Home Experiment
  Locate several cans each containing different types of food. First, predict which can will win the race down an
  inclined plane and explain why. See if your prediction is correct. You could also do this experiment by collecting
  several empty cylindrical containers of the same size and filling them with different materials such as wet or dry
  sand.

              EXAMPLE 10.10

      Calculating the Speed of a Cylinder Rolling Down an Incline
      Calculate the final speed of a solid cylinder that rolls down a 2.00-m-high incline. The cylinder starts from rest, has a
      mass of 0.750 kg, and has a radius of 4.00 cm.

      Strategy

      We can solve for the final velocity using conservation of energy, but we must first express rotational quantities in
      terms of translational quantities to end up with as the only unknown.

      Solution

      Conservation of energy for this situation is written as described above:

                                                                                                                           10.85

      Before we can solve for , we must get an expression for from Figure 10.11. Because and                 are related (note
      here that the cylinder is rolling without slipping), we must also substitute the relationship             into the
      expression. These substitutions yield

                                                                                                                           10.86

      Interestingly, the cylinder’s radius     and mass   cancel, yielding

                                                                                                                           10.87

      Solving algebraically, the equation for the final velocity   gives


                                                                                                                           10.88


      Substituting known values into the resulting expression yields


                                                                                                                           10.89


      Discussion

      Because      and    cancel, the result                is valid for any solid cylinder, implying that all solid cylinders will
      roll down an incline at the same rate independent of their masses and sizes. (Rolling cylinders down inclines is what
      Galileo actually did to show that objects fall at the same rate independent of mass.) Note that if the cylinder slid
      without friction down the incline without rolling, then the entire gravitational potential energy would go into
      translational kinetic energy. Thus,                 and              , which is 22% greater than            . That is, the
      cylinder would go faster at the bottom.

example of both kinetic and translational kinetic energy is found in a bike tire while being ridden down a bike path.
The rotational motion of the tire means it has rotational kinetic energy while the movement of the bike along the
path means the tire also has translational kinetic energy. If you were to lift the front wheel of the bike and spin it
while the bike is stationary, then the wheel would have only rotational kinetic energy relative to the Earth.


10.5 Angular Momentum and Its Conservation
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Understand the analogy between angular momentum and linear momentum.
 • Observe the relationship between torque and angular momentum.
 • Apply the law of conservation of angular momentum.

Why does Earth keep on spinning? What started it spinning to begin with? And how does an ice skater manage to
spin faster and faster simply by pulling her arms in? Why does she not have to exert a torque to spin faster?
Questions like these have answers based in angular momentum, the rotational analog to linear momentum.

By now the pattern is clear—every rotational phenomenon has a direct translational analog. It seems quite
reasonable, then, to define angular momentum as
                                                                                                                10.90
This equation is an analog to the definition of linear momentum as           . Units for linear momentum are
while units for angular momentum are               . As we would expect, an object that has a large moment of inertia
 , such as Earth, has a very large angular momentum. An object that has a large angular velocity , such as a
centrifuge, also has a rather large angular momentum.


 Making Connections
 Angular momentum is completely analogous to linear momentum, first presented in Uniform Circular Motion and
 Gravitation. It has the same implications in terms of carrying rotation forward, and it is conserved when the net
 external torque is zero. Angular momentum, like linear momentum, is also a property of the atoms and
 subatomic particles.

      Discussion

      This number is large, demonstrating that Earth, as expected, has a tremendous angular momentum. The answer is
      approximate, because we have assumed a constant density for Earth in order to estimate its moment of inertia.


      When you push a merry-go-round, spin a bike wheel, or open a door, you exert a torque. If the torque you exert is
      greater than opposing torques, then the rotation accelerates, and angular momentum increases. The greater the net
      torque, the more rapid the increase in . The relationship between torque and angular momentum is

                                                                                                                                  10.95

      This expression is exactly analogous to the relationship between force and linear momentum,                  . The
      equation              is very fundamental and broadly applicable. It is, in fact, the rotational form of Newton’s
      second law.

      Calculating the Torque Putting Angular Momentum Into a Rotating Food Tray
      Figure 10.19 shows a rotating food tray, often called a lazy Susan, being turned by a person in quest of sustenance.
      Suppose the person exerts a 2.50 N force perpendicular to the lazy Susan’s 0.260-m radius for 0.150 s. (a) What is
      the final angular momentum of the lazy Susan if it starts from rest, assuming friction is negligible? (b) What is the
      final angular velocity of the lazy Susan, given that its mass is 4.00 kg and assuming its moment of inertia is that of a
      disk?




      FIGURE 10.19 A partygoer exerts a torque on a lazy Susan to make it rotate. The equation         gives the relationship between
      torque and the angular momentum produced.

      Strategy

      We can find the angular momentum by solving                           for     , and using the given information to calculate the
      torque. The final angular momentum equals the change in angular momentum, because the lazy Susan starts from
      rest. That is,        . To find the final velocity, we must calculate from the definition of in  .

Because the force is perpendicular to , we see that                         , so that

                                                                                                                                   10.97

Solution for (b)

The final angular velocity can be calculated from the definition of angular momentum,

Solving for     and substituting the formula for the moment of inertia of a disk into the resulting equation gives

                                                                                                                                   10.99

And substituting known values into the preceding equation yields

                                                                                                                                 10.100


Discussion

Note that the imparted angular momentum does not depend on any property of the object but only on torque and
time. The final angular velocity is equivalent to one revolution in 8.71 s (determination of the time period is left as an
exercise for the reader), which is about right for a lazy Susan.



        EXAMPLE 10.13

Calculating the Torque in a Kick
The person whose leg is shown in Figure 10.20 kicks his leg by exerting a 2000-N force with his upper leg muscle.

Strategy

The angular acceleration can be found using the rotational analog to Newton’s second law, or             . The
moment of inertia is given and the torque can be found easily from the given force and perpendicular lever arm.
Once the angular acceleration is known, the final angular velocity and rotational kinetic energy can be calculated.

Solution to (a)

From the rotational analog to Newton’s second law, the angular acceleration                   is

      Because the force and the perpendicular lever arm are given and the leg is vertical so that its weight does not create
      a torque, the net torque is thus


                                                                                                                      10.102


      Substituting this value for the torque and the given value for the moment of inertia into the expression for    gives

                                                                                                                      10.103

      Solution to (b)

      The final angular velocity can be calculated from the kinematic expression

                                                                                                                      10.104

      because the initial angular velocity is zero. The kinetic energy of rotation is

                                                                                                                      10.106

      so it is most convenient to use the value of     just found and the given value for the moment of inertia. The kinetic
      energy is then


                                                                                                                      10.107


      Discussion

      These values are reasonable for a person kicking his leg starting from the position shown. The weight of the leg can
      be neglected in part (a) because it exerts no torque when the center of gravity of the lower leg is directly beneath
      the pivot in the knee. In part (b), the force exerted by the upper leg is so large that its torque is much greater than
      that created by the weight of the lower leg as it rotates. The rotational kinetic energy given to the lower leg is
      enough that it could give a ball a significant velocity by transferring some of this energy in a kick.



        Making Connections: Conservation Laws
        Angular momentum, like energy and linear momentum, is conserved. This universally applicable law is another
        sign of underlying unity in physical laws. Angular momentum is conserved when net external torque is zero, just
        as linear momentum is conserved when the net external force is zero.


      Conservation of Angular Momentum
      We can now understand why Earth keeps on spinning. As we saw in the previous example,                           . This
      equation means that, to change angular momentum, a torque must act over some period of time. Because Earth has
      a large angular momentum, a large torque acting over a long time is needed to change its rate of spin. So what
      external torques are there? Tidal friction exerts torque that is slowing Earth’s rotation, but tens of millions of years
      must pass before the change is very significant. Recent research indicates the length of the day was 18 h some 900
      million years ago. Only the tides exert significant retarding torques on Earth, and so it will continue to spin, although
      ever more slowly, for many billions of years.

What we have here is, in fact, another conservation law. If the net torque is zero, then angular momentum is
constant or conserved. We can see this rigorously by considering                for the situation in which the net
torque is zero. In that case,
                                                                                                                                   10.108
implying that

                                                                                                                                   10.109

If the change in angular momentum                is zero, then the angular momentum is constant; thus,
                                                                                                                                   10.110
or
                                                                                                                                   10.111
These expressions are the law of conservation of angular momentum. Conservation laws are as scarce as they are
important.

An example of conservation of angular momentum is seen in Figure 10.21, in which an ice skater is executing a spin.
The net torque on her is very close to zero, because there is relatively little friction between her skates and the ice
and because the friction is exerted very close to the pivot point. (Both and are small, and so is negligibly
small.) Consequently, she can spin for quite some time. She can do something else, too. She can increase her rate of
spin by pulling her arms and legs in. Why does pulling her arms and legs in increase her rate of spin? The answer is
that her angular momentum is constant, so that
                                                                                                                                   10.112
Expressing this equation in terms of the moment of inertia,
                                                                                                                                   10.113
where the primed quantities refer to conditions after she has pulled in her arms and reduced her moment of inertia.
Because is smaller, the angular velocity      must increase to keep the angular momentum constant. The change
can be dramatic, as the following example shows.




FIGURE 10.21 (a) An ice skater is spinning on the tip of her skate with her arms extended. Her angular momentum is conserved because
the net torque on her is negligibly small. In the next image, her rate of spin increases greatly when she pulls in her arms, decreasing her
moment of inertia. The work she does to pull in her arms results in an increase in rotational kinetic energy.


        EXAMPLE 10.14

Calculating the Angular Momentum of a Spinning Skater
Suppose an ice skater, such as the one in Figure 10.21, is spinning at 0.800 rev/ s with her arms extended. She has a
moment of inertia of               with her arms extended and of                   with her arms close to her body.
(These moments of inertia are based on reasonable assumptions about a 60.0-kg skater.) (a) What is her angular
velocity in revolutions per second after she pulls in her arms? (b) What is her rotational kinetic energy before and
after she does this?

      Strategy

      In the first part of the problem, we are looking for the skater’s angular velocity     after she has pulled in her arms.
      To find this quantity, we use the conservation of angular momentum and note that the moments of inertia and initial
      angular velocity are given. To find the initial and final kinetic energies, we use the definition of rotational kinetic
      energy given by

                                                                                                                     10.114

      Solution for (a)

      Because torque is negligible (as discussed above), the conservation of angular momentum given in                  is
      applicable. Thus,
                                                                                                                     10.115
      or
                                                                                                                     10.116
      Solving for    and substituting known values into the resulting equation gives


                                                                                                                     10.117


      Solution for (b)

      Rotational kinetic energy is given by

                                                                                                                     10.118

      The initial value is found by substituting known values into the equation and converting the angular velocity to rad/s:


                                                                                                                     10.119


      The final rotational kinetic energy is

                                                                                                                     10.120

      Substituting known values into this equation gives


                                                                                                                     10.121


      Discussion

      In both parts, there is an impressive increase. First, the final angular velocity is large, although most world-class
      skaters can achieve spin rates about this great. Second, the final kinetic energy is much greater than the initial
      kinetic energy. The increase in rotational kinetic energy comes from work done by the skater in pulling in her arms.
      This work is internal work that depletes some of the skater’s food energy.


      There are several other examples of objects that increase their rate of spin because something reduced their
      moment of inertia. Tornadoes are one example. Storm systems that create tornadoes are slowly rotating. When the
      radius of rotation narrows, even in a local region, angular velocity increases, sometimes to the furious level of a
      tornado. Earth is another example. Our planet was born from a huge cloud of gas and dust, the rotation of which
      came from turbulence in an even larger cloud. Gravitational forces caused the cloud to contract, and the rotation
      rate increased as a result. (See Figure 10.22.)

FIGURE 10.22 The Solar System coalesced from a cloud of gas and dust that was originally rotating. The orbital motions and spins of the
planets are in the same direction as the original spin and conserve the angular momentum of the parent cloud.

In case of human motion, one would not expect angular momentum to be conserved when a body interacts with the
environment as its foot pushes off the ground. Astronauts floating in space aboard the International Space Station
have no angular momentum relative to the inside of the ship if they are motionless. Their bodies will continue to
have this zero value no matter how they twist about as long as they do not give themselves a push off the side of the
vessel.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Is angular momentum completely analogous to linear momentum? What, if any, are their differences?
Solution
Yes, angular and linear momentums are completely analogous. While they are exact analogs they have different
units and are not directly inter-convertible like forms of energy are.


10.6 Collisions of Extended Bodies in Two Dimensions
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Observe collisions of extended bodies in two dimensions.
 • Examine collision at the point of percussion.

Bowling pins are sent flying and spinning when hit by a bowling ball—angular momentum as well as linear
momentum and energy have been imparted to the pins. (See Figure 10.23). Many collisions involve angular
momentum. Cars, for example, may spin and collide on ice or a wet surface. Baseball pitchers throw curves by
putting spin on the baseball. A tennis player can put a lot of top spin on the tennis ball which causes it to dive down
onto the court once it crosses the net. We now take a brief look at what happens when objects that can rotate
collide.

Consider the relatively simple collision shown in Figure 10.24, in which a disk strikes and adheres to an initially
motionless stick nailed at one end to a frictionless surface. After the collision, the two rotate about the nail. There is
an unbalanced external force on the system at the nail. This force exerts no torque because its lever arm is zero.
Angular momentum is therefore conserved in the collision. Kinetic energy is not conserved, because the collision is
inelastic. It is possible that momentum is not conserved either because the force at the nail may have a component

      FIGURE 10.24 (a) A disk slides toward a motionless stick on a frictionless surface. (b) The disk hits the stick at one end and adheres to it,
      and they rotate together, pivoting around the nail. Angular momentum is conserved for this inelastic collision because the surface is
      frictionless and the unbalanced external force at the nail exerts no torque.


              EXAMPLE 10.15

      Rotation in a Collision
      Suppose the disk in Figure 10.24 has a mass of 50.0 g and an initial velocity of 30.0 m/s when it strikes the stick
      that is 1.20 m long and 2.00 kg.

      (a) What is the angular velocity of the two after the collision?

      (b) What is the kinetic energy before and after the collision?

      (c) What is the total linear momentum before and after the collision?

      Strategy for (a)

      We can answer the first question using conservation of angular momentum as noted. Because angular momentum is
        , we can solve for angular velocity.

      Solution for (a)

      Conservation of angular momentum states
                                                                                                                                           10.122
      where primed quantities stand for conditions after the collision and both momenta are calculated relative to the
      pivot point. The initial angular momentum of the system of stick-disk is that of the disk just before it strikes the stick.
      That is,
                                                                                                                                           10.123
      where is the moment of inertia of the disk and is its angular velocity around the pivot point. Now,

                                                                                                                                           10.124

It is   that we wish to find. Conservation of angular momentum gives
                                                                                                                      10.126
Rearranging the equation yields


                                                                                                                      10.127
                                                                ′
where is the moment of inertia of the stick and disk stuck together, which is the sum of their individual moments
of inertia about the nail. Figure 10.11 gives the formula for a rod rotating around one end to be          . Thus,

                                           ′                                                                          10.128

Entering known values in this equation yields,

                                                                                                                      10.129

The value of      is now entered into the expression for    , which yields


                                                                                                                      10.130


Strategy for (b)

The kinetic energy before the collision is the incoming disk’s translational kinetic energy, and after the collision, it is
the rotational kinetic energy of the two stuck together.

Solution for (b)

First, we calculate the translational kinetic energy by entering given values for the mass and speed of the incoming
disk.

                                                                                                                      10.131

After the collision, the rotational kinetic energy can be found because we now know the final angular velocity and
the final moment of inertia. Thus, entering the values into the rotational kinetic energy equation gives


                                                                                                                      10.132


Strategy for (c)

The linear momentum before the collision is that of the disk. After the collision, it is the sum of the disk’s
momentum and that of the center of mass of the stick.

Solution of (c)

Before the collision, then, linear momentum is

                                                                                                                      10.133

After the collision, the disk and the stick’s center of mass move in the same direction. The total linear momentum is
that of the disk moving at a new velocity             plus that of the stick’s center of mass,

which moves at half this speed because                          . Thus,

                                                                                                                      10.134

      Gathering similar terms in the equation yields,

                                                                                                                      10.135

      Substituting known values into the equation,

                                                                                                                      10.137

      Discussion

      First note that the kinetic energy is less after the collision, as predicted, because the collision is inelastic. More
      surprising is that the momentum after the collision is actually greater than before the collision. This result can be
      understood if you consider how the nail affects the stick and vice versa. Apparently, the stick pushes backward on
      the nail when first struck by the disk. The nail’s reaction (consistent with Newton’s third law) is to push forward on
      the stick, imparting momentum to it in the same direction in which the disk was initially moving, thereby increasing
      the momentum of the system.


      The above example has other implications. For example, what would happen if the disk hit very close to the nail?
      Obviously, a force would be exerted on the nail in the forward direction. So, when the stick is struck at the end
      farthest from the nail, a backward force is exerted on the nail, and when it is hit at the end nearest the nail, a
      forward force is exerted on the nail. Thus, striking it at a certain point in between produces no force on the nail. This
      intermediate point is known as the percussion point.

      An analogous situation occurs in tennis as seen in Figure 10.25. If you hit a ball with the end of your racquet, the
      handle is pulled away from your hand. If you hit a ball much farther down, for example, on the shaft of the racquet,
      the handle is pushed into your palm. And if you hit the ball at the racquet’s percussion point (what some people call
      the “sweet spot”), then little or no force is exerted on your hand, and there is less vibration, reducing chances of a
      tennis elbow. The same effect occurs for a baseball bat.

FIGURE 10.25 A disk hitting a stick is compared to a tennis ball being hit by a racquet. (a) When the ball strikes the racquet near the end, a
backward force is exerted on the hand. (b) When the racquet is struck much farther down, a forward force is exerted on the hand. (c) When
the racquet is struck at the percussion point, no force is delivered to the hand.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Is rotational kinetic energy a vector? Justify your answer.
Solution
No, energy is always scalar whether motion is involved or not. No form of energy has a direction in space and you
can see that rotational kinetic energy does not depend on the direction of motion just as linear kinetic energy is
independent of the direction of motion.

      10.7 Gyroscopic Effects: Vector Aspects of Angular Momentum
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Describe the right-hand rule to find the direction of angular velocity, momentum, and torque.
       • Explain the gyroscopic effect.
       • Study how Earth acts like a gigantic gyroscope.

      Angular momentum is a vector and, therefore, has direction as well as magnitude. Torque affects both the direction
      and the magnitude of angular momentum. What is the direction of the angular momentum of a rotating object like
      the disk in Figure 10.26? The figure shows the right-hand rule used to find the direction of both angular momentum
      and angular velocity. Both and are vectors—each has direction and magnitude. Both can be represented by
      arrows. The right-hand rule defines both to be perpendicular to the plane of rotation in the direction shown. Because
      angular momentum is related to angular velocity by              , the direction of is the same as the direction of .
      Notice in the figure that both point along the axis of rotation.




      FIGURE 10.26 Figure (a) shows a disk is rotating counterclockwise when viewed from above. Figure (b) shows the right-hand rule. The
      direction of angular velocity size and angular momentum are defined to be the direction in which the thumb of your right hand points
      when you curl your fingers in the direction of the disk’s rotation as shown.

      Now, recall that torque changes angular momentum as expressed by

                                                                                                                                  10.138

      This equation means that the direction of      is the same as the direction of the torque that creates it. This result
      is illustrated in Figure 10.27, which shows the direction of torque and the angular momentum it creates.

      Let us now consider a bicycle wheel with a couple of handles attached to it, as shown in Figure 10.28. (This device is
      popular in demonstrations among physicists, because it does unexpected things.) With the wheel rotating as shown,
      its angular momentum is to the woman's left. Suppose the person holding the wheel tries to rotate it as in the figure.
      Her natural expectation is that the wheel will rotate in the direction she pushes it—but what happens is quite
      different. The forces exerted create a torque that is horizontal toward the person, as shown in Figure 10.28(a). This
      torque creates a change in angular momentum in the same direction, perpendicular to the original angular
      momentum , thus changing the direction of but not the magnitude of . Figure 10.28 shows how                and add,
      giving a new angular momentum with direction that is inclined more toward the person than before. The axis of the
      wheel has thus moved perpendicular to the forces exerted on it, instead of in the expected direction.

FIGURE 10.27 In figure (a), the torque is perpendicular to the plane formed by and and is the direction your right thumb would point to
if you curled your fingers in the direction of . Figure (b) shows that the direction of the torque is the same as that of the angular
momentum it produces.




FIGURE 10.28 In figure (a), a person holding the spinning bike wheel lifts it with her right hand and pushes down with her left hand in an
attempt to rotate the wheel. This action creates a torque directly toward her. This torque causes a change in angular momentum         in
exactly the same direction. Figure (b) shows a vector diagram depicting how        and add, producing a new angular momentum pointing
more toward the person. The wheel moves toward the person, perpendicular to the forces she exerts on it.

This same logic explains the behavior of gyroscopes. Figure 10.29 shows the two forces acting on a spinning
gyroscope. The torque produced is perpendicular to the angular momentum, thus the direction of the torque is
changed, but not its magnitude. The gyroscope precesses around a vertical axis, since the torque is always
horizontal and perpendicular to . If the gyroscope is not spinning, it acquires angular momentum in the direction of
the torque (         ), and it rotates around a horizontal axis, falling over just as we would expect.

Earth itself acts like a gigantic gyroscope. Its angular momentum is along its axis and points at Polaris, the North
Star. But Earth is slowly precessing (once in about 26,000 years) due to the torque of the Sun and the Moon on its
nonspherical shape.
428   10 • Rotational Motion and Angular Momentum




      FIGURE 10.29 As seen in figure (a), the forces on a spinning gyroscope are its weight and the supporting force from the stand. These forces
      create a horizontal torque on the gyroscope, which create a change in angular momentum         that is also horizontal. In figure (b), and
        add to produce a new angular momentum with the same magnitude, but different direction, so that the gyroscope precesses in the
      direction shown instead of falling over.

INTRODUCTION TO FLUID STATICS Much of what we value in life is fluid: a breath of fresh winter air; the hot blue
flame in our gas cooker; the water we drink, swim in, and bathe in; the blood in our veins. What exactly is a fluid?
Can we understand fluids with the laws already presented, or will new laws emerge from their study? The physical
characteristics of static or stationary fluids and some of the laws that govern their behavior are the topics of this
chapter. Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications explores aspects of fluid flow.

      matter. Solids have a definite shape and a specific volume, liquids have a definite volume but their shape changes
      depending on the container in which they are held, gases have neither a definite shape nor a specific volume as their
      molecules move to fill the container in which they are held, and plasmas also have neither definite shape nor
      volume. (See Figure 11.2.) Liquids, gases, and plasmas are considered to be fluids because they yield to shearing
      forces, whereas solids resist them. Note that the extent to which fluids yield to shearing forces (and hence flow
      easily and quickly) depends on a quantity called the viscosity which is discussed in detail in Viscosity and Laminar
      Flow; Poiseuille’s Law. We can understand the phases of matter and what constitutes a fluid by considering the
      forces between atoms that make up matter in the three phases.




      FIGURE 11.2 (a) Atoms in a solid always have the same neighbors, held near home by forces represented here by springs. These atoms are
      essentially in contact with one another. A rock is an example of a solid. This rock retains its shape because of the forces holding its atoms
      together. (b) Atoms in a liquid are also in close contact but can slide over one another. Forces between them strongly resist attempts to
      push them closer together and also hold them in close contact. Water is an example of a liquid. Water can flow, but it also remains in an
      open container because of the forces between its atoms. (c) Atoms in a gas are separated by distances that are considerably larger than the
      size of the atoms themselves, and they move about freely. A gas must be held in a closed container to prevent it from moving out freely. (d)
      A plasma is composed of electrons, protons, and ions that, like gases, are spaced far apart and move about freely.

      Atoms in solids are in close contact, with forces between them that allow the atoms to vibrate but not to change
      positions with neighboring atoms. (These forces can be thought of as springs that can be stretched or compressed,
      but not easily broken.) Thus a solid resists all types of stress. A solid cannot be easily deformed because the atoms
      that make up the solid are not able to move about freely. Solids also resist compression, because their atoms form
      part of a lattice structure in which the atoms are a relatively fixed distance apart. Under compression, the atoms
      would be forced into one another. Most of the examples we have studied so far have involved solid objects which
      deform very little when stressed.


        Connections: Submicroscopic Explanation of Solids and Liquids
        Atomic and molecular characteristics explain and underlie the macroscopic characteristics of solids and fluids.
        This submicroscopic explanation is one theme of this text and is highlighted in the Things Great and Small
        features in Conservation of Momentum. See, for example, microscopic description of collisions and momentum
        or microscopic description of pressure in a gas. This present section is devoted entirely to the submicroscopic
        explanation of solids and liquids.


      In contrast, liquids deform easily when stressed and do not spring back to their original shape once the force is
      removed because the atoms are free to slide about and change neighbors—that is, they flow (so they are a type of
      fluid), with the molecules held together by their mutual attraction. When a liquid is placed in a container with no lid
      on, it remains in the container (providing the container has no holes below the surface of the liquid!). Because the
      atoms are closely packed, liquids, like solids, resist compression.

      Atoms in gases and charged particles in plasmas are separated by distances that are large compared with the size of
      the particles. The forces between the particles are therefore very weak, except when they collide with one another.
      Gases and plasmas thus not only flow (and are therefore considered to be fluids) but they are relatively easy to
      compress because there is much space and little force between the particles. When placed in an open container
      gases, unlike liquids, will escape. The major distinction is that gases are easily compressed, whereas liquids are not.
      Plasmas are difficult to contain because they have so much energy. When discussing how substances flow, we shall
      generally refer to both gases and liquids simply as fluids, and make a distinction between them only when they
      behave differently.

11.2 Density
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define density.
 • Calculate the mass of a reservoir from its density.
 • Compare and contrast the densities of various substances.

Which weighs more, a ton of feathers or a ton of bricks? This old riddle plays with the distinction between mass and
density. A ton is a ton, of course; but bricks have much greater density than feathers, and so we are tempted to think
of them as heavier. (See Figure 11.3.)

Density, as you will see, is an important characteristic of substances. It is crucial, for example, in determining
whether an object sinks or floats in a fluid. Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance or object. In equation
form, density is defined as

                                                                                                                     11.1

where the Greek letter   (rho) is the symbol for density,   is the mass, and        is the volume occupied by the
substance.


 Density
 Density is mass per unit volume.

                                                                                                                    11.2

 where    is the symbol for density,   is the mass, and     is the volume occupied by the substance.


In the riddle regarding the feathers and bricks, the masses are the same, but the volume occupied by the feathers is
much greater, since their density is much lower. The SI unit of density is        , representative values are given in
Table 11.1. The metric system was originally devised so that water would have a density of             , equivalent to
            . Thus the basic mass unit, the kilogram, was first devised to be the mass of 1000 mL of water, which has
a volume of 1000 cm3.

FIGURE 11.3 A ton of feathers and a ton of bricks have the same mass, but the feathers make a much bigger pile because they have a much
lower density.

As you can see by examining Table 11.1, the density of an object may help identify its composition. The density of
gold, for example, is about 2.5 times the density of iron, which is about 2.5 times the density of aluminum. Density
also reveals something about the phase of the matter and its substructure. Notice that the densities of liquids and
solids are roughly comparable, consistent with the fact that their atoms are in close contact. The densities of gases
are much less than those of liquids and solids, because the atoms in gases are separated by large amounts of empty
space.


  Take-Home Experiment Sugar and Salt
  A pile of sugar and a pile of salt look pretty similar, but which weighs more? If the volumes of both piles are the
  same, any difference in mass is due to their different densities (including the air space between crystals). Which
  do you think has the greater density? What values did you find? What method did you use to determine these
  values?



        EXAMPLE 11.1

Calculating the Mass of a Reservoir From Its Volume
A reservoir has a surface area of           and an average depth of 40.0 m. What mass of water is held behind the
dam? (See Figure 11.4 for a view of a large reservoir—the Three Gorges Dam site on the Yangtze River in central
China.)

Strategy

We can calculate the volume of the reservoir from its dimensions, and find the density of water                    in Table 11.1.
Then the mass can be found from the definition of density

                                                                                                                                11.3

Solution

Solving equation               for   gives           .

The volume       of the reservoir is its surface area      times its average depth :


                                                                                                                                11.4


The density of water      from Table 11.1 is                           . Substituting     and    into the expression for mass
gives


                                                                                                                                11.5

      Discussion

      A large reservoir contains a very large mass of water. In this example, the weight of the water in the reservoir is
                            , where is the acceleration due to the Earth’s gravity (about            ). It is reasonable to
      ask whether the dam must supply a force equal to this tremendous weight. The answer is no. As we shall see in the
      following sections, the force the dam must supply can be much smaller than the weight of the water it holds back.




      FIGURE 11.4 Three Gorges Dam in central China. When completed in 2008, this became the world’s largest hydroelectric plant, generating
      power equivalent to that generated by 22 average-sized nuclear power plants. The concrete dam is 181 m high and 2.3 km across. The
      reservoir made by this dam is 660 km long. Over 1 million people were displaced by the creation of the reservoir. (credit: Le Grand Portage)

      11.3 Pressure
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define pressure.
       • Explain the relationship between pressure and force.
       • Calculate force given pressure and area.

      You have no doubt heard the word pressure being used in relation to blood (high or low blood pressure) and in
      relation to the weather (high- and low-pressure weather systems). These are only two of many examples of
      pressures in fluids. Pressure is defined as

                                                                                                                                           11.6

      where      is a force applied to an area        that is perpendicular to the force.


        Pressure
        Pressure is defined as the force divided by the area perpendicular to the force over which the force is applied, or

                                                                                                                                         11.7



      A given force can have a significantly different effect depending on the area over which the force is exerted, as
      shown in Figure 11.5. The SI unit for pressure is the pascal, where

                                                                                                                                           11.8

      In addition to the pascal, there are many other units for pressure that are in common use. In meteorology,
      atmospheric pressure is often described in units of millibar (mb), where

                                                                                                                                           11.9

mercury (mm Hg) is still often used in the measurement of blood pressure. Pressure is defined for all states of
matter but is particularly important when discussing fluids.

        EXAMPLE 11.2

Calculating Force Exerted by the Air: What Force Does a Pressure Exert?
An astronaut is working outside the International Space Station where the atmospheric pressure is essentially zero.
The pressure gauge on her air tank reads               . What force does the air inside the tank exert on the flat end
of the cylindrical tank, a disk 0.150 m in diameter?

Strategy

We can find the force exerted from the definition of pressure given in                        , provided we can find the area           acted
upon.

Solution

By rearranging the definition of pressure to solve for force, we see that
                                                                                                                                       11.10
Here, the pressure        is given, as is the area of the end of the cylinder           , given by             . Thus,


                                                                                                                                       11.11


Discussion

Wow! No wonder the tank must be strong. Since we found              , we see that the force exerted by a pressure is
directly proportional to the area acted upon as well as the pressure itself.


The force exerted on the end of the tank is perpendicular to its inside surface. This direction is because the force is
exerted by a static or stationary fluid. We have already seen that fluids cannot withstand shearing (sideways) forces;
they cannot exert shearing forces, either. Fluid pressure has no direction, being a scalar quantity. The forces due to
pressure have well-defined directions: they are always exerted perpendicular to any surface. (See the tire in Figure
11.6, for example.) Finally, note that pressure is exerted on all surfaces. Swimmers, as well as the tire, feel pressure
on all sides. (See Figure 11.7.)

      The arrows represent the directions and magnitudes of the forces exerted at various points on the swimmer. Note that the forces are larger
      underneath, due to greater depth, giving a net upward or buoyant force that is balanced by the weight of the swimmer.

      11.4 Variation of Pressure with Depth in a Fluid
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define pressure in terms of weight.
       • Explain the variation of pressure with depth in a fluid.
       • Calculate density given pressure and altitude.

      If your ears have ever popped on a plane flight or ached during a deep dive in a swimming pool, you have
      experienced the effect of depth on pressure in a fluid. At the Earth’s surface, the air pressure exerted on you is a
      result of the weight of air above you. This pressure is reduced as you climb up in altitude and the weight of air above
      you decreases. Under water, the pressure exerted on you increases with increasing depth. In this case, the pressure
      being exerted upon you is a result of both the weight of water above you and that of the atmosphere above you. You

meter or so below the surface of a pool to feel a pressure increase. The difference is that water is much denser than
air, about 775 times as dense.

Consider the container in Figure 11.8. Its bottom supports the weight of the fluid in it. Let us calculate the pressure
exerted on the bottom by the weight of the fluid. That pressure is the weight of the fluid      divided by the area
supporting it (the area of the bottom of the container):

                                                                                                                                    11.12

We can find the mass of the fluid from its volume and density:
                                                                                                                                    11.13
The volume of the fluid        is related to the dimensions of the container. It is
                                                                                                                                    11.14
where      is the cross-sectional area and         is the depth. Combining the last two equations gives
                                                                                                                                    11.15
If we enter this into the expression for pressure, we obtain

                                                                                                                                    11.16

The area cancels, and rearranging the variables yields
                                                                                                                                    11.17
This value is the pressure due to the weight of a fluid. The equation has general validity beyond the special
conditions under which it is derived here. Even if the container were not there, the surrounding fluid would still exert
this pressure, keeping the fluid static. Thus the equation          represents the pressure due to the weight of any
fluid of average density at any depth below its surface. For liquids, which are nearly incompressible, this
equation holds to great depths. For gases, which are quite compressible, one can apply this equation as long as the
density changes are small over the depth considered. Example 11.4 illustrates this situation.




FIGURE 11.8 The bottom of this container supports the entire weight of the fluid in it. The vertical sides cannot exert an upward force on
the fluid (since it cannot withstand a shearing force), and so the bottom must support it all.

Calculating the Average Pressure and Force Exerted: What Force Must a Dam Withstand?
In Example 11.1, we calculated the mass of water in a large reservoir. We will now consider the pressure and force
acting on the dam retaining water. (See Figure 11.9.) The dam is 500 m wide, and the water is 80.0 m deep at the
dam. (a) What is the average pressure on the dam due to the water? (b) Calculate the force exerted against the dam
and compare it with the weight of water in the dam (previously found to be                ).
448   11 • Fluid Statics



      Strategy for (a)

      The average pressure due to the weight of the water is the pressure at the average depth                       of 40.0 m, since
      pressure increases linearly with depth.

      Solution for (a)

      The average pressure due to the weight of a fluid is

                                                                                                                                        11.18

      Entering the density of water from Table 11.1 and taking              to be the average depth of 40.0 m, we obtain


                                                                                                                                        11.19


      Strategy for (b)

      The force exerted on the dam by the water is the average pressure times the area of contact:
                                                                                                                                        11.20

      We have already found the value for           . The area of the dam is                                                    , so that

      Discussion

      Although this force seems large, it is small compared with the                 weight of the water in the reservoir—in
      fact, it is only       of the weight. Note that the pressure found in part (a) is completely independent of the width
      and length of the lake—it depends only on its average depth at the dam. Thus the force depends only on the water’s
      average depth and the dimensions of the dam, not on the horizontal extent of the reservoir. In the diagram, the
      thickness of the dam increases with depth to balance the increasing force due to the increasing pressure.epth to
      balance the increasing force due to the increasing pressure.




      FIGURE 11.9 The dam must withstand the force exerted against it by the water it retains. This force is small compared with the weight of
      the water behind the dam.

      Atmospheric pressure is another example of pressure due to the weight of a fluid, in this case due to the weight of
      air above a given height. The atmospheric pressure at the Earth’s surface varies a little due to the large-scale flow of
      the atmosphere induced by the Earth’s rotation (this creates weather “highs” and “lows”). However, the average
      pressure at sea level is given by the standard atmospheric pressure      , measured to be

This relationship means that, on average, at sea level, a column of air above                   of the Earth’s surface has a
weight of              , equivalent to       . (See Figure 11.10.)

extending to the top of the atmosphere, weighs            .

Calculating Average Density: How Dense Is the Air?
Calculate the average density of the atmosphere, given that it extends to an altitude of 120 km. Compare this

Strategy

If we solve            for density, we see that

                                                                                                                               11.23

We then take      to be atmospheric pressure,       is given, and   is known, and so we can use this to calculate .

Solution

Entering known values into the expression for         yields

                                                                                                                               11.24


Discussion

This result is the average density of air between the Earth’s surface and the top of the Earth’s atmosphere, which
essentially ends at 120 km. The density of air at sea level is given in Table 11.1 as             —about 15 times its
average value. Because air is so compressible, its density has its highest value near the Earth’s surface and declines
rapidly with altitude.

      Then we take         to be 1.00 atm and   to be the density of the water that creates the pressure.

      Solution

      Entering the known values into the expression for       gives


                                                                                                                        11.26


      Discussion

      Just 10.3 m of water creates the same pressure as 120 km of air. Since water is nearly incompressible, we can
      neglect any change in its density over this depth.


      What do you suppose is the total pressure at a depth of 10.3 m in a swimming pool? Does the atmospheric pressure
      on the water’s surface affect the pressure below? The answer is yes. This seems only logical, since both the water’s
      weight and the atmosphere’s weight must be supported. So the total pressure at a depth of 10.3 m is 2 atm—half
      from the water above and half from the air above. We shall see in Pascal’s Principle that fluid pressures always add
      in this way.

      11.5 Pascal’s Principle
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define pressure.
       • State Pascal’s principle.
       • Understand applications of Pascal’s principle.
       • Derive relationships between forces in a hydraulic system.

      Pressure is defined as force per unit area. Can pressure be increased in a fluid by pushing directly on the fluid? Yes,
      but it is much easier if the fluid is enclosed. The heart, for example, increases blood pressure by pushing directly on
      the blood in an enclosed system (valves closed in a chamber). If you try to push on a fluid in an open system, such
      as a river, the fluid flows away. An enclosed fluid cannot flow away, and so pressure is more easily increased by an
      applied force.

      What happens to a pressure in an enclosed fluid? Since atoms in a fluid are free to move about, they transmit the
      pressure to all parts of the fluid and to the walls of the container. Remarkably, the pressure is transmitted
      undiminished. This phenomenon is called Pascal’s principle, because it was first clearly stated by the French
      philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal (1623–1662): A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is
      transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and to the walls of its container.


        Pascal’s Principle
        A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and to
        the walls of its container.


      Pascal’s principle, an experimentally verified fact, is what makes pressure so important in fluids. Since a change in
      pressure is transmitted undiminished in an enclosed fluid, we often know more about pressure than other physical
      quantities in fluids. Moreover, Pascal’s principle implies that the total pressure in a fluid is the sum of the pressures
      from different sources. We shall find this fact—that pressures add—very useful.

Blaise Pascal had an interesting life in that he was home-schooled by his father who removed all of the mathematics
textbooks from his house and forbade him to study mathematics until the age of 15. This, of course, raised the boy’s
curiosity, and by the age of 12, he started to teach himself geometry. Despite this early deprivation, Pascal went on
to make major contributions in the mathematical fields of probability theory, number theory, and geometry. He is
also well known for being the inventor of the first mechanical digital calculator, in addition to his contributions in the
field of fluid statics.

Application of Pascal’s Principle
One of the most important technological applications of Pascal’s principle is found in a hydraulic system, which is an
enclosed fluid system used to exert forces. The most common hydraulic systems are those that operate car brakes.
Let us first consider the simple hydraulic system shown in Figure 11.11.




FIGURE 11.11 A typical hydraulic system with two fluid-filled cylinders, capped with pistons and connected by a tube called a hydraulic
line. A downward force     on the left piston creates a pressure that is transmitted undiminished to all parts of the enclosed fluid. This
results in an upward force    on the right piston that is larger than    because the right piston has a larger area.

Relationship Between Forces in a Hydraulic System
We can derive a relationship between the forces in the simple hydraulic system shown in Figure 11.11 by applying
Pascal’s principle. Note first that the two pistons in the system are at the same height, and so there will be no
difference in pressure due to a difference in depth. Now the pressure due to       acting on area    is simply
            , as defined by            . According to Pascal’s principle, this pressure is transmitted undiminished
throughout the fluid and to all walls of the container. Thus, a pressure                 is felt at the other piston that is equal to
   . That is        .

But since              , we see that                 .

This equation relates the ratios of force to area in any hydraulic system, providing the pistons are at the same
vertical height and that friction in the system is negligible. Hydraulic systems can increase or decrease the force
applied to them. To make the force larger, the pressure is applied to a larger area. For example, if a 100-N force is
applied to the left cylinder in Figure 11.11 and the right one has an area five times greater, then the force out is 500
N. Hydraulic systems are analogous to simple levers, but they have the advantage that pressure can be sent through
tortuously curved lines to several places at once.

Calculating Force of Wheel Cylinders: Pascal Puts on the Brakes
Consider the automobile hydraulic system shown in Figure 11.12.
452   11 • Fluid Statics




      FIGURE 11.12 Hydraulic brakes use Pascal’s principle. The driver exerts a force of 100 N on the brake pedal. This force is increased by the
      simple lever and again by the hydraulic system. Each of the identical wheel cylinders receives the same pressure and, therefore, creates the
      same force output    . The circular cross-sectional areas of the pedal and wheel cylinders are represented by    and      , respectively

      A force of 100 N is applied to the brake pedal, which acts on the pedal cylinder through a lever. A force of 500 N is
      exerted on the pedal cylinder. (The reader can verify that the force is 500 N using techniques of statics from
      Applications of Statics, Including Problem-Solving Strategies.) Pressure created in the pedal cylinder is transmitted
      to four wheel cylinders. The pedal cylinder has a diameter of 0.500 cm, and each wheel cylinder has a diameter of
      2.50 cm. Calculate the force      created at each of the wheel cylinders.

      Strategy

      We are given the force         that is applied to the pedal cylinder. The cross-sectional areas                and      can be
      calculated from their given diameters. Then                       can be used to find the force         . Manipulate this
      algebraically to get       on one side and substitute known values:

      Solution

                                                                                                                                         11.27


      Discussion

      This value is the force exerted by each of the four wheel cylinders. Note that we can add as many wheel cylinders as
      we wish. If each has a 2.50-cm diameter, each will exert


      A simple hydraulic system, such as a simple machine, can increase force but cannot do more work than done on it.
      Work is force times distance moved, and the wheel cylinder moves through a smaller distance than the pedal
      cylinder. Furthermore, the more wheels added, the smaller the distance each moves. Many hydraulic systems—such
      as power brakes and those in bulldozers—have a motorized pump that actually does most of the work in the system.

  Making Connections: Conservation of Energy
  Conservation of energy applied to a hydraulic system tells us that the system cannot do more work than is done
  on it. Work transfers energy, and so the work output cannot exceed the work input. Power brakes and other
  similar hydraulic systems use pumps to supply extra energy when needed.


11.6 Gauge Pressure, Absolute Pressure, and Pressure Measurement
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define gauge pressure and absolute pressure.
 • Understand the working of aneroid and open-tube barometers.

If you limp into a gas station with a nearly flat tire, you will notice the tire gauge on the airline reads nearly zero
when you begin to fill it. In fact, if there were a gaping hole in your tire, the gauge would read zero, even though
atmospheric pressure exists in the tire. Why does the gauge read zero? There is no mystery here. Tire gauges are
simply designed to read zero at atmospheric pressure and positive when pressure is greater than atmospheric.

Similarly, atmospheric pressure adds to blood pressure in every part of the circulatory system. (As noted in Pascal’s
Principle, the total pressure in a fluid is the sum of the pressures from different sources—here, the heart and the
atmosphere.) But atmospheric pressure has no net effect on blood flow since it adds to the pressure coming out of
the heart and going back into it, too. What is important is how much greater blood pressure is than atmospheric
pressure. Blood pressure measurements, like tire pressures, are thus made relative to atmospheric pressure.

In brief, it is very common for pressure gauges to ignore atmospheric pressure—that is, to read zero at atmospheric
pressure. We therefore define gauge pressure to be the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. Gauge pressure
is positive for pressures above atmospheric pressure, and negative for pressures below it.


  Gauge Pressure
  Gauge pressure is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. Gauge pressure is positive for pressures above
  atmospheric pressure, and negative for pressures below it.


In fact, atmospheric pressure does add to the pressure in any fluid not enclosed in a rigid container. This happens
because of Pascal’s principle. The total pressure, or absolute pressure, is thus the sum of gauge pressure and
atmospheric pressure:                      where        is absolute pressure,   is gauge pressure, and        is
atmospheric pressure. For example, if your tire gauge reads 34 psi (pounds per square inch), then the absolute
pressure is 34 psi plus 14.7 psi (   in psi), or 48.7 psi (equivalent to 336 kPa).


  Absolute Pressure
  Absolute pressure is the sum of gauge pressure and atmospheric pressure.


For reasons we will explore later, in most cases the absolute pressure in fluids cannot be negative. Fluids push
rather than pull, so the smallest absolute pressure is zero. (A negative absolute pressure is a pull.) Thus the smallest
possible gauge pressure is               (this makes       zero). There is no theoretical limit to how large a gauge
pressure can be.

There are a host of devices for measuring pressure, ranging from tire gauges to blood pressure cuffs. Pascal’s
principle is of major importance in these devices. The undiminished transmission of pressure through a fluid allows
precise remote sensing of pressures. Remote sensing is often more convenient than putting a measuring device into
a system, such as a person’s artery.

Figure 11.13 shows one of the many types of mechanical pressure gauges in use today. In all mechanical pressure
454   11 • Fluid Statics



      gauges, pressure results in a force that is converted (or transduced) into some type of readout.




                 FIGURE 11.13 This aneroid gauge utilizes flexible bellows connected to a mechanical indicator to measure pressure.

      An entire class of gauges uses the property that pressure due to the weight of a fluid is given by             Consider
      the U-shaped tube shown in Figure 11.14, for example. This simple tube is called a manometer. In Figure 11.14(a),
      both sides of the tube are open to the atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure therefore pushes down on each side
      equally so its effect cancels. If the fluid is deeper on one side, there is a greater pressure on the deeper side, and the
      fluid flows away from that side until the depths are equal.

      Let us examine how a manometer is used to measure pressure. Suppose one side of the U-tube is connected to
      some source of pressure          such as the toy balloon in Figure 11.14(b) or the vacuum-packed peanut jar shown in
      Figure 11.14(c). Pressure is transmitted undiminished to the manometer, and the fluid levels are no longer equal. In
      Figure 11.14(b),        is greater than atmospheric pressure, whereas in Figure 11.14(c),        is less than

      density of the fluid in the manometer. In Figure 11.14(b),        can support a column of fluid of height , and so it
      must exert a pressure         greater than atmospheric pressure (the gauge pressure      is positive). In Figure
      11.14(c), atmospheric pressure can support a column of fluid of height , and so    is less than atmospheric
      pressure by an amount      (the gauge pressure    is negative). A manometer with one side open to the
      atmosphere is an ideal device for measuring gauge pressures. The gauge pressure is                                and is found by
      measuring .




      FIGURE 11.14 An open-tube manometer has one side open to the atmosphere. (a) Fluid depth must be the same on both sides, or the
      pressure each side exerts at the bottom will be unequal and there will be flow from the deeper side. (b) A positive gauge pressure
      transmitted to one side of the manometer can support a column of fluid of height . (c) Similarly, atmospheric pressure is greater than a
      negative gauge pressure      by an amount      . The jar’s rigidity prevents atmospheric pressure from being transmitted to the peanuts.

      Mercury manometers are often used to measure arterial blood pressure. An inflatable cuff is placed on the upper
      arm as shown in Figure 11.15. By squeezing the bulb, the person making the measurement exerts pressure, which is
      transmitted undiminished to both the main artery in the arm and the manometer. When this applied pressure
      exceeds blood pressure, blood flow below the cuff is cut off. The person making the measurement then slowly
      lowers the applied pressure and listens for blood flow to resume. Blood pressure pulsates because of the pumping
      action of the heart, reaching a maximum, called systolic pressure, and a minimum, called diastolic pressure, with

each heartbeat. Systolic pressure is measured by noting the value of when blood flow first begins as cuff pressure
is lowered. Diastolic pressure is measured by noting when blood flows without interruption. The typical blood
pressure of a young adult raises the mercury to a height of 120 mm at systolic and 80 mm at diastolic. This is
commonly quoted as 120 over 80, or 120/80. The first pressure is representative of the maximum output of the
heart; the second is due to the elasticity of the arteries in maintaining the pressure between beats. The density of
the mercury fluid in the manometer is 13.6 times greater than water, so the height of the fluid will be 1/13.6 of that
in a water manometer. This reduced height can make measurements difficult, so mercury manometers are used to
measure larger pressures, such as blood pressure. The density of mercury is such that                          .


  Systolic Pressure
  Systolic pressure is the maximum blood pressure.



  Diastolic Pressure
  Diastolic pressure is the minimum blood pressure.

flow is detected just below the cuff, and corresponding pressures are transmitted to a mercury-filled manometer. (credit: U.S. Army photo

        EXAMPLE 11.7

Calculating Height of IV Bag: Blood Pressure and Intravenous Infusions
Intravenous infusions are usually made with the help of the gravitational force. Assuming that the density of the
456   11 • Fluid Statics



      fluid being administered is 1.00 g/ml, at what height should the IV bag be placed above the entry point so that the
      fluid just enters the vein if the blood pressure in the vein is 18 mm Hg above atmospheric pressure? Assume that the
      IV bag is collapsible.

      Strategy for (a)

      For the fluid to just enter the vein, its pressure at entry must exceed the blood pressure in the vein (18 mm Hg above
      atmospheric pressure). We therefore need to find the height of fluid that corresponds to this gauge pressure.

      Solution

      We first need to convert the pressure into SI units. Since                                 ,

                                                                                                                                    11.28


      Rearranging               for     gives         . Substituting known values into this equation gives


                                                                                                                                    11.29


      Discussion

      The IV bag must be placed at 0.24 m above the entry point into the arm for the fluid to just enter the arm. Generally,
      IV bags are placed higher than this. You may have noticed that the bags used for blood collection are placed below
      the donor to allow blood to flow easily from the arm to the bag, which is the opposite direction of flow than required
      in the example presented here.


      A barometer is a device that measures atmospheric pressure. A mercury barometer is shown in Figure 11.16. This
      device measures atmospheric pressure, rather than gauge pressure, because there is a nearly pure vacuum above
      the mercury in the tube. The height of the mercury is such that              . When atmospheric pressure varies, the
      mercury rises or falls, giving important clues to weather forecasters. The barometer can also be used as an
      altimeter, since average atmospheric pressure varies with altitude. Mercury barometers and manometers are so
      common that units of mm Hg are often quoted for atmospheric pressure and blood pressures. Table 11.2 gives
      conversion factors for some of the more commonly used units of pressure.




      FIGURE 11.16 A mercury barometer measures atmospheric pressure. The pressure due to the mercury’s weight,         , equals atmospheric
      pressure. The atmosphere is able to force mercury in the tube to a height because the pressure above the mercury is zero.

11.7 Archimedes’ Principle
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define buoyant force.
 • State Archimedes’ principle.
 • Understand why objects float or sink.
 • Understand the relationship between density and Archimedes’ principle.

When you rise from lounging in a warm bath, your arms feel strangely heavy. This is because you no longer have the
buoyant support of the water. Where does this buoyant force come from? Why is it that some things float and others
do not? Do objects that sink get any support at all from the fluid? Is your body buoyed by the atmosphere, or are
only helium balloons affected? (See Figure 11.17.)




FIGURE 11.17 (a) Even objects that sink, like this anchor, are partly supported by water when submerged. (b) Submarines have adjustable
density (ballast tanks) so that they may float or sink as desired. (credit: Allied Navy) (c) Helium-filled balloons tug upward on their strings,
demonstrating air’s buoyant effect. (credit: Crystl)

Answers to all these questions, and many others, are based on the fact that pressure increases with depth in a fluid.
This means that the upward force on the bottom of an object in a fluid is greater than the downward force on the top
of the object. There is a net upward, or buoyant force on any object in any fluid. (See Figure 11.18.) If the buoyant
force is greater than the object’s weight, the object will rise to the surface and float. If the buoyant force is less than
458   11 • Fluid Statics



      the object’s weight, the object will sink. If the buoyant force equals the object’s weight, the object will remain
      suspended at that depth. The buoyant force is always present whether the object floats, sinks, or is suspended in a
      fluid.


        Buoyant Force
        The buoyant force is the net upward force on any object in any fluid.




      FIGURE 11.18 Pressure due to the weight of a fluid increases with depth since            . This pressure and associated upward force on the
      bottom of the cylinder are greater than the downward force on the top of the cylinder. Their difference is the buoyant force  . (Horizontal
      forces cancel.)

      Just how great is this buoyant force? To answer this question, think about what happens when a submerged object
      is removed from a fluid, as in Figure 11.19.




      FIGURE 11.19 (a) An object submerged in a fluid experiences a buoyant force             . If    is greater than the weight of the object, the object
      will rise. If  is less than the weight of the object, the object will sink. (b) If the object is removed, it is replaced by fluid having weight      .
      Since this weight is supported by surrounding fluid, the buoyant force must equal the weight of the fluid displaced. That is,                  ,a

Greek mathematician and inventor Archimedes (ca. 287–212 B.C.) that he stated this principle long before concepts
of force were well established. Stated in words, Archimedes’ principle is as follows: The buoyant force on an object
equals the weight of the fluid it displaces. In equation form, Archimedes’ principle is
                                                                                                                     11.30
where      is the buoyant force and        is the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. Archimedes’ principle is
valid in general, for any object in any fluid, whether partially or totally submerged.


  Archimedes’ Principle
  According to this principle the buoyant force on an object equals the weight of the fluid it displaces. In equation
  form, Archimedes’ principle is
                                                                                                                   11.31

Humm … High-tech body swimsuits were introduced in 2008 in preparation for the Beijing Olympics. One concern
(and international rule) was that these suits should not provide any buoyancy advantage. How do you think that this
rule could be verified?


  Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation
  The density of aluminum foil is 2.7 times the density of water. Take a piece of foil, roll it up into a ball and drop it
  into water. Does it sink? Why or why not? Can you make it sink?


Floating and Sinking
Drop a lump of clay in water. It will sink. Then mold the lump of clay into the shape of a boat, and it will float.
Because of its shape, the boat displaces more water than the lump and experiences a greater buoyant force. The
same is true of steel ships.


       EXAMPLE 11.8

Calculating buoyant force: dependency on shape
(a) Calculate the buoyant force on 10,000 metric tons                of solid steel completely submerged in water,
and compare this with the steel’s weight. (b) What is the maximum buoyant force that water could exert on this
same steel if it were shaped into a boat that could displace             of water?

Strategy for (a)

To find the buoyant force, we must find the weight of water displaced. We can do this by using the densities of water
and steel given in Table 11.1. We note that, since the steel is completely submerged, its volume and the water’s
volume are the same. Once we know the volume of water, we can find its mass and weight.

Solution for (a)

First, we use the definition of density         to find the steel’s volume, and then we substitute values for mass and
density. This gives

                                                                                                                     11.32

Because the steel is completely submerged, this is also the volume of water displaced,   . We can now find the
mass of water displaced from the relationship between its volume and density, both of which are known. This gives

                                                                                                                             11.33


      By Archimedes’ principle, the weight of water displaced is           , so the buoyant force is


                                                                                                                             11.34


      The steel’s weight is                     , which is much greater than the buoyant force, so the steel will remain
      submerged. Note that the buoyant force is rounded to two digits because the density of steel is given to only two
      digits.

      Strategy for (b)

      Here we are given the maximum volume of water the steel boat can displace. The buoyant force is the weight of this
      volume of water.

      Solution for (b)

      The mass of water displaced is found from its relationship to density and volume, both of which are known. That is,


                                                                                                                             11.35


      The maximum buoyant force is the weight of this much water, or


                                                                                                                             11.36


      Discussion

      The maximum buoyant force is ten times the weight of the steel, meaning the ship can carry a load nine times its
      own weight without sinking.

        What is the mass of this amount of foil? (b) If the foil is folded to give it four sides, and paper clips or washers are
        added to this “boat,” what shape of the boat would allow it to hold the most “cargo” when placed in water? Test
        your prediction.


      Density and Archimedes’ Principle
      Density plays a crucial role in Archimedes’ principle. The average density of an object is what ultimately determines
      whether it floats. If its average density is less than that of the surrounding fluid, it will float. This is because the fluid,
      having a higher density, contains more mass and hence more weight in the same volume. The buoyant force, which
      equals the weight of the fluid displaced, is thus greater than the weight of the object. Likewise, an object denser
      than the fluid will sink.

      The extent to which a floating object is submerged depends on how the object’s density is related to that of the
      fluid. In Figure 11.20, for example, the unloaded ship has a lower density and less of it is submerged compared with
      the same ship loaded. We can derive a quantitative expression for the fraction submerged by considering density.
      The fraction submerged is the ratio of the volume submerged to the volume of the object, or

                                                                                                                             11.37

      The volume submerged equals the volume of fluid displaced, which we call             . Now we can obtain the relationship

between the densities by substituting                   into the expression. This gives


                                                                                                                                      11.38

where         is the average density of the object and             is the density of the fluid. Since the object floats, its mass
and that of the displaced fluid are equal, and so they cancel from the equation, leaving

                                                                                                                                      11.39




                            FIGURE 11.20 An unloaded ship (a) floats higher in the water than a loaded ship (b).

We use this last relationship to measure densities. This is done by measuring the fraction of a floating object that is
submerged—for example, with a hydrometer. It is useful to define the ratio of the density of an object to a fluid
(usually water) as specific gravity:

                                                                                                                                      11.40

where is the average density of the object or substance and              is the density of water at 4.00°C. Specific gravity is
dimensionless, independent of whatever units are used for . If an object floats, its specific gravity is less than one.
If it sinks, its specific gravity is greater than one. Moreover, the fraction of a floating object that is submerged equals
its specific gravity. If an object’s specific gravity is exactly 1, then it will remain suspended in the fluid, neither
sinking nor floating. Scuba divers try to obtain this state so that they can hover in the water. We measure the specific
gravity of fluids, such as battery acid, radiator fluid, and urine, as an indicator of their condition. One device for
measuring specific gravity is shown in Figure 11.21.


  Specific Gravity
  Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of an object to a fluid (usually water).




FIGURE 11.21 This hydrometer is floating in a fluid of specific gravity 0.87. The glass hydrometer is filled with air and weighted with lead at

              EXAMPLE 11.9

      Calculating Average Density: Floating Woman
      Suppose a 60.0-kg woman floats in freshwater with                      of her volume submerged when her lungs are full of air.
      What is her average density?

      Strategy

      We can find the woman’s density by solving the equation

                                                                                                                                          11.41

      for the density of the object. This yields

                                                                                                                                          11.42

      We know both the fraction submerged and the density of water, and so we can calculate the woman’s density.

      Solution

      Entering the known values into the expression for her density, we obtain

                                                                                                                                          11.43

      Discussion

      Her density is less than the fluid density. We expect this because she floats. Body density is one indicator of a
      person’s percent body fat, of interest in medical diagnostics and athletic training. (See Figure 11.22.)

      of strategic fatty areas are used to calculate the percent body fat.

      There are many obvious examples of lower-density objects or substances floating in higher-density fluids—oil on
      water, a hot-air balloon, a bit of cork in wine, an iceberg, and hot wax in a “lava lamp,” to name a few. Less obvious

examples include lava rising in a volcano and mountain ranges floating on the higher-density crust and mantle
beneath them. Even seemingly solid Earth has fluid characteristics.

More Density Measurements
One of the most common techniques for determining density is shown in Figure 11.23.




FIGURE 11.23 (a) A coin is weighed in air. (b) The apparent weight of the coin is determined while it is completely submerged in a fluid of
known density. These two measurements are used to calculate the density of the coin.

An object, here a coin, is weighed in air and then weighed again while submerged in a liquid. The density of the coin,
an indication of its authenticity, can be calculated if the fluid density is known. This same technique can also be
used to determine the density of the fluid if the density of the coin is known. All of these calculations are based on
Archimedes’ principle.

Archimedes’ principle states that the buoyant force on the object equals the weight of the fluid displaced. This, in
turn, means that the object appears to weigh less when submerged; we call this measurement the object’s apparent
weight. The object suffers an apparent weight loss equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. Alternatively, on
balances that measure mass, the object suffers an apparent mass loss equal to the mass of fluid displaced. That is

                                                                                                                                    11.44

or

                                                                                                                                    11.45

The next example illustrates the use of this technique.


        EXAMPLE 11.10

Calculating Density: Is the Coin Authentic?
The mass of an ancient Greek coin is determined in air to be 8.630 g. When the coin is submerged in water as shown
in Figure 11.23, its apparent mass is 7.800 g. Calculate its density, given that water has a density of
and that effects caused by the wire suspending the coin are negligible.

Strategy

To calculate the coin’s density, we need its mass (which is given) and its volume. The volume of the coin equals the
volume of water displaced. The volume of water displaced        can be found by solving the equation for density
       for .

Solution

The volume of water is                   where         is the mass of water displaced. As noted, the mass of the water
displaced equals the apparent mass loss, which is                                                         . Thus the volume of water is
                                       . This is also the volume of the coin, since it is completely submerged. We can now

find the density of the coin using the definition of density:

      Discussion

      You can see from Table 11.1 that this density is very close to that of pure silver, appropriate for this type of ancient
      coin. Most modern counterfeits are not pure silver.


      This brings us back to Archimedes’ principle and how it came into being. As the story goes, the king of Syracuse
      gave Archimedes the task of determining whether the royal crown maker was supplying a crown of pure gold. The
      purity of gold is difficult to determine by color (it can be diluted with other metals and still look as yellow as pure
      gold), and other analytical techniques had not yet been conceived. Even ancient peoples, however, realized that the
      density of gold was greater than that of any other then-known substance. Archimedes purportedly agonized over his
      task and had his inspiration one day while at the public baths, pondering the support the water gave his body. He
      came up with his now-famous principle, saw how to apply it to determine density, and ran naked down the streets of
      Syracuse crying “Eureka!” (Greek for “I have found it”). Similar behavior can be observed in contemporary physicists
      from time to time!

      11.8 Cohesion and Adhesion in Liquids: Surface Tension and Capillary Action
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Understand cohesive and adhesive forces.
       • Define surface tension.
       • Understand capillary action.

      Cohesion and Adhesion in Liquids
      Children blow soap bubbles and play in the spray of a sprinkler on a hot summer day. (See Figure 11.24.) An
      underwater spider keeps his air supply in a shiny bubble he carries wrapped around him. A technician draws blood
      into a small-diameter tube just by touching it to a drop on a pricked finger. A premature infant struggles to inflate her
      lungs. What is the common thread? All these activities are dominated by the attractive forces between atoms and
      molecules in liquids—both within a liquid and between the liquid and its surroundings.

      Attractive forces between molecules of the same type are called cohesive forces. Liquids can, for example, be held
      in open containers because cohesive forces hold the molecules together. Attractive forces between molecules of
      different types are called adhesive forces. Such forces cause liquid drops to cling to window panes, for example. In
      this section we examine effects directly attributable to cohesive and adhesive forces in liquids.

Surface Tension
Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area.
This general effect is called surface tension. Molecules on the surface are pulled inward by cohesive forces,
reducing the surface area. Molecules inside the liquid experience zero net force, since they have neighbors on all
sides.


 Surface Tension
 Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface
 area. This general effect is called surface tension.



 Making Connections: Surface Tension
 Forces between atoms and molecules underlie the macroscopic effect called surface tension. These attractive
 forces pull the molecules closer together and tend to minimize the surface area. This is another example of a
 submicroscopic explanation for a macroscopic phenomenon.


The model of a liquid surface acting like a stretched elastic sheet can effectively explain surface tension effects. For
example, some insects can walk on water (as opposed to floating in it) as we would walk on a trampoline—they dent
the surface as shown in Figure 11.25(a). Figure 11.25(b) shows another example, where a needle rests on a water
surface. The iron needle cannot, and does not, float, because its density is greater than that of water. Rather, its
weight is supported by forces in the stretched surface that try to make the surface smaller or flatter. If the needle
were placed point down on the surface, its weight acting on a smaller area would break the surface, and it would
sink.

      FIGURE 11.25 Surface tension supporting the weight of an insect and an iron needle, both of which rest on the surface without penetrating
      it. They are not floating; rather, they are supported by the surface of the liquid. (a) An insect leg dents the water surface.     is a restoring
      force (surface tension) parallel to the surface. (b) An iron needle similarly dents a water surface until the restoring force (surface tension)
      grows to equal its weight.

      Surface tension is proportional to the strength of the cohesive force, which varies with the type of liquid. Surface
      tension is defined to be the force F per unit length exerted by a stretched liquid membrane:

                                                                                                                                              11.47

      Table 11.3 lists values of for some liquids. For the insect of Figure 11.25(a), its weight is supported by the
      upward components of the surface tension force:                   , where is the circumference of the insect’s foot in
      contact with the water. Figure 11.26 shows one way to measure surface tension. The liquid film exerts a force on the
      movable wire in an attempt to reduce its surface area. The magnitude of this force depends on the surface tension
      of the liquid and can be measured accurately.

      Surface tension is the reason why liquids form bubbles and droplets. The inward surface tension force causes
      bubbles to be approximately spherical and raises the pressure of the gas trapped inside relative to atmospheric
      pressure outside. It can be shown that the gauge pressure inside a spherical bubble is given by

                                                                                                                                              11.48

      where is the radius of the bubble. Thus the pressure inside a bubble is greatest when the bubble is the smallest.
      Another bit of evidence for this is illustrated in Figure 11.27. When air is allowed to flow between two balloons of
      unequal size, the smaller balloon tends to collapse, filling the larger balloon.

FIGURE 11.26 Sliding wire device used for measuring surface tension; the device exerts a force to reduce the film’s surface area. The force
needed to hold the wire in place is                   , since there are two liquid surfaces attached to the wire. This force remains nearly
constant as the film is stretched, until the film approaches its breaking point.




FIGURE 11.27 With the valve closed, two balloons of different sizes are attached to each end of a tube. Upon opening the valve, the smaller
balloon decreases in size with the air moving to fill the larger balloon. The pressure in a spherical balloon is inversely proportional to its
radius, so that the smaller balloon has a greater internal pressure than the larger balloon, resulting in this flow.

              EXAMPLE 11.11

      Surface Tension: Pressure Inside a Bubble
      Calculate the gauge pressure inside a soap bubble                         in radius using the surface tension for soapy
      water in Table 11.3. Convert this pressure to mm Hg.

      Strategy

      The radius is given and the surface tension can be found in Table 11.3, and so          can be found directly from the
      equation             .

      Solution

      Substituting and         into the equation         , we obtain

                                                                                                                           11.49

      We use a conversion factor to get this into units of mm Hg:

                                                                                                                           11.50

      Discussion

      Note that if a hole were to be made in the bubble, the air would be forced out, the bubble would decrease in radius,
      and the gauge pressure would reduce to zero, and the absolute pressure inside would decrease to atmospheric
      pressure (760 mm Hg).


      Our lungs contain hundreds of millions of mucus-lined sacs called alveoli, which are very similar in size, and about
      0.1 mm in diameter. (See Figure 11.28.) You can exhale without muscle action by allowing surface tension to
      contract these sacs. Medical patients whose breathing is aided by a positive pressure respirator have air blown into
      the lungs, but are generally allowed to exhale on their own. Even if there is paralysis, surface tension in the alveoli
      will expel air from the lungs. Since pressure increases as the radii of the alveoli decrease, an occasional deep
      cleansing breath is needed to fully reinflate the alveoli. Respirators are programmed to do this and we find it natural,
      as do our companion dogs and cats, to take a cleansing breath before settling into a nap.

FIGURE 11.28 Bronchial tubes in the lungs branch into ever-smaller structures, finally ending in alveoli. The alveoli act like tiny bubbles.
The surface tension of their mucous lining aids in exhalation and can prevent inhalation if too great.

The tension in the walls of the alveoli results from the membrane tissue and a liquid on the walls of the alveoli
containing a long lipoprotein that acts as a surfactant (a surface-tension reducing substance). The need for the
surfactant results from the tendency of small alveoli to collapse and the air to fill into the larger alveoli making them
even larger (as demonstrated in Figure 11.27). During inhalation, the lipoprotein molecules are pulled apart and the
wall tension increases as the radius increases (increased surface tension). During exhalation, the molecules slide
back together and the surface tension decreases, helping to prevent a collapse of the alveoli. The surfactant
therefore serves to change the wall tension so that small alveoli don’t collapse and large alveoli are prevented from
expanding too much. This tension change is a unique property of these surfactants, and is not shared by detergents
(which simply lower surface tension). (See Figure 11.29.)




FIGURE 11.29 Surface tension as a function of surface area. The surface tension for lung surfactant decreases with decreasing area. This
ensures that small alveoli don’t collapse and large alveoli are not able to over expand.

If water gets into the lungs, the surface tension is too great and you cannot inhale. This is a severe problem in
resuscitating drowning victims. A similar problem occurs in newborn infants who are born without this
surfactant—their lungs are very difficult to inflate. This condition is known as hyaline membrane disease and is a
leading cause of death for infants, particularly in premature births. Some success has been achieved in treating
hyaline membrane disease by spraying a surfactant into the infant’s breathing passages. Emphysema produces the
opposite problem with alveoli. Alveolar walls of emphysema victims deteriorate, and the sacs combine to form
larger sacs. Because pressure produced by surface tension decreases with increasing radius, these larger sacs
produce smaller pressure, reducing the ability of emphysema victims to exhale. A common test for emphysema is to
measure the pressure and volume of air that can be exhaled.

  (1) Try floating a sewing needle on water. In order for this activity to work, the needle needs to be very clean as
  even the oil from your fingers can be sufficient to affect the surface properties of the needle. (2) Place the
  bristles of a paint brush into water. Pull the brush out and notice that for a short while, the bristles will stick
470   11 • Fluid Statics



        together. The surface tension of the water surrounding the bristles is sufficient to hold the bristles together. As
        the bristles dry out, the surface tension effect dissipates. (3) Place a loop of thread on the surface of still water
        in such a way that all of the thread is in contact with the water. Note the shape of the loop. Now place a drop of
        detergent into the middle of the loop. What happens to the shape of the loop? Why? (4) Sprinkle pepper onto the
        surface of water. Add a drop of detergent. What happens? Why? (5) Float two matches parallel to each other and
        add a drop of detergent between them. What happens? Note: For each new experiment, the water needs to be
        replaced and the bowl washed to free it of any residual detergent.


      Adhesion and Capillary Action
      Why is it that water beads up on a waxed car but does not on bare paint? The answer is that the adhesive forces
      between water and wax are much smaller than those between water and paint. Competition between the forces of
      adhesion and cohesion are important in the macroscopic behavior of liquids. An important factor in studying the
      roles of these two forces is the angle between the tangent to the liquid surface and the surface. (See Figure
      11.30.) The contact angle is directly related to the relative strength of the cohesive and adhesive forces. The
      larger the strength of the cohesive force relative to the adhesive force, the larger is, and the more the liquid tends
      to form a droplet. The smaller is, the smaller the relative strength, so that the adhesive force is able to flatten the
      drop. Table 11.4 lists contact angles for several combinations of liquids and solids.


        Contact Angle
        The angle     between the tangent to the liquid surface and the surface is called the contact angle.




      FIGURE 11.30 In the photograph, water beads on the waxed car paint and flattens on the unwaxed paint. (a) Water forms beads on the
      waxed surface because the cohesive forces responsible for surface tension are larger than the adhesive forces, which tend to flatten the
      drop. (b) Water beads on bare paint are flattened considerably because the adhesive forces between water and paint are strong,
      overcoming surface tension. The contact angle is directly related to the relative strengths of the cohesive and adhesive forces. The larger
        is, the larger the ratio of cohesive to adhesive forces. (credit: P. P. Urone)

      One important phenomenon related to the relative strength of cohesive and adhesive forces is capillary action—the
      tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube. This action causes blood to be
      drawn into a small-diameter tube when the tube touches a drop.


        Capillary Action
        The tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube, is called capillary action.


      If a capillary tube is placed vertically into a liquid, as shown in Figure 11.31, capillary action will raise or suppress
      the liquid inside the tube depending on the combination of substances. The actual effect depends on the relative
      strength of the cohesive and adhesive forces and, thus, the contact angle given in the table. If is less than           ,

then the fluid will be raised; if is greater than   , it will be suppressed. Mercury, for example, has a very large
surface tension and a large contact angle with glass. When placed in a tube, the surface of a column of mercury
curves downward, somewhat like a drop. The curved surface of a fluid in a tube is called a meniscus. The tendency
of surface tension is always to reduce the surface area. Surface tension thus flattens the curved liquid surface in a
capillary tube. This results in a downward force in mercury and an upward force in water, as seen in Figure 11.31.




FIGURE 11.31 (a) Mercury is suppressed in a glass tube because its contact angle is greater than          . Surface tension exerts a downward
force as it flattens the mercury, suppressing it in the tube. The dashed line shows the shape the mercury surface would have without the
flattening effect of surface tension. (b) Water is raised in a glass tube because its contact angle is nearly . Surface tension therefore exerts
an upward force when it flattens the surface to reduce its area.

Capillary action can move liquids horizontally over very large distances, but the height to which it can raise or
suppress a liquid in a tube is limited by its weight. It can be shown that this height is given by

                                                                                                                                      11.51

If we look at the different factors in this expression, we might see how it makes good sense. The height is directly

      proportional to the surface tension , which is its direct cause. Furthermore, the height is inversely proportional to
      tube radius—the smaller the radius , the higher the fluid can be raised, since a smaller tube holds less mass. The
      height is also inversely proportional to fluid density , since a larger density means a greater mass in the same
      volume. (See Figure 11.32.)




      FIGURE 11.32 (a) Capillary action depends on the radius of a tube. The smaller the tube, the greater the height reached. The height is
      negligible for large-radius tubes. (b) A denser fluid in the same tube rises to a smaller height, all other factors being the same.


              EXAMPLE 11.12

      Calculating Radius of a Capillary Tube: Capillary Action: Tree Sap
      Can capillary action be solely responsible for sap rising in trees? To answer this question, calculate the radius of a
      capillary tube that would raise sap 100 m to the top of a giant redwood, assuming that sap’s density is                ,
      its contact angle is zero, and its surface tension is the same as that of water at       .

      Strategy

      The height to which a liquid will rise as a result of capillary action is given by                         , and every quantity is
      known except for .

      Solution

      Solving for and substituting known values produces


                                                                                                                                         11.52


      Discussion

      This result is unreasonable. Sap in trees moves through the xylem, which forms tubes with radii as small as
                      . This value is about 180 times as large as the radius found necessary here to raise sap    . This
      means that capillary action alone cannot be solely responsible for sap getting to the tops of trees.


      How does sap get to the tops of tall trees? (Recall that a column of water can only rise to a height of 10 m when
      there is a vacuum at the top—see Example 11.5.) The question has not been completely resolved, but it appears that
      it is pulled up like a chain held together by cohesive forces. As each molecule of sap enters a leaf and evaporates (a
      process called transpiration), the entire chain is pulled up a notch. So a negative pressure created by water
      evaporation must be present to pull the sap up through the xylem vessels. In most situations, fluids can push but
      can exert only negligible pull, because the cohesive forces seem to be too small to hold the molecules tightly
      together. But in this case, the cohesive force of water molecules provides a very strong pull. Figure 11.33 shows one

device for studying negative pressure. Some experiments have demonstrated that negative pressures sufficient to
pull sap to the tops of the tallest trees can be achieved.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Explain the concept of pressure the in human body.
 • Explain systolic and diastolic blood pressures.
 • Describe pressures in the eye, lungs, spinal column, bladder, and skeletal system.

Pressure in the Body
Next to taking a person’s temperature and weight, measuring blood pressure is the most common of all medical
examinations. Control of high blood pressure is largely responsible for the significant decreases in heart attack and
stroke fatalities achieved in the last three decades. The pressures in various parts of the body can be measured and
often provide valuable medical indicators. In this section, we consider a few examples together with some of the
physics that accompanies them.

Table 11.5 lists some of the measured pressures in mm Hg, the units most commonly quoted.

      Blood Pressure
      Common arterial blood pressure measurements typically produce values of 120 mm Hg and 80 mm Hg,
      respectively, for systolic and diastolic pressures. Both pressures have health implications. When systolic pressure is
      chronically high, the risk of stroke and heart attack is increased. If, however, it is too low, fainting is a problem.
      Systolic pressure increases dramatically during exercise to increase blood flow and returns to normal afterward.
      This change produces no ill effects and, in fact, may be beneficial to the tone of the circulatory system. Diastolic
      pressure can be an indicator of fluid balance. When low, it may indicate that a person is hemorrhaging internally and
      needs a transfusion. Conversely, high diastolic pressure indicates a ballooning of the blood vessels, which may be
      due to the transfusion of too much fluid into the circulatory system. High diastolic pressure is also an indication that
      blood vessels are not dilating properly to pass blood through. This can seriously strain the heart in its attempt to
      pump blood.

      Blood leaves the heart at about 120 mm Hg but its pressure continues to decrease (to almost 0) as it goes from the
      aorta to smaller arteries to small veins (see Figure 11.34). The pressure differences in the circulation system are
      caused by blood flow through the system as well as the position of the person. For a person standing up, the
      pressure in the feet will be larger than at the heart due to the weight of the blood           . If we assume that the
      distance between the heart and the feet of a person in an upright position is 1.4 m, then the increase in pressure in
      the feet relative to that in the heart (for a static column of blood) is given by

                                                                                                                      11.53

      Standing a long time can lead to an accumulation of blood in the legs and swelling. This is the reason why soldiers
      who are required to stand still for long periods of time have been known to faint. Elastic bandages around the calf
      can help prevent this accumulation and can also help provide increased pressure to enable the veins to send blood
      back up to the heart. For similar reasons, doctors recommend tight stockings for long-haul flights.

      Blood pressure may also be measured in the major veins, the heart chambers, arteries to the brain, and the lungs.

But these pressures are usually only monitored during surgery or for patients in intensive care since the
measurements are invasive. To obtain these pressure measurements, qualified health care workers thread thin
tubes, called catheters, into appropriate locations to transmit pressures to external measuring devices.

The heart consists of two pumps—the right side forcing blood through the lungs and the left causing blood to flow
through the rest of the body (Figure 11.34). Right-heart failure, for example, results in a rise in the pressure in the
vena cavae and a drop in pressure in the arteries to the lungs. Left-heart failure results in a rise in the pressure
entering the left side of the heart and a drop in aortal pressure. Implications of these and other pressures on flow in
the circulatory system will be discussed in more detail in Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical
Applications.


  Two Pumps of the Heart
  The heart consists of two pumps—the right side forcing blood through the lungs and the left causing blood to
  flow through the rest of the body.




FIGURE 11.34 Schematic of the circulatory system showing typical pressures. The two pumps in the heart increase pressure and that
pressure is reduced as the blood flows through the body. Long-term deviations from these pressures have medical implications discussed
in some detail in the Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications. Only aortal or arterial blood pressure can be measured
noninvasively.

Pressure in the Eye
The shape of the eye is maintained by fluid pressure, called intraocular pressure, which is normally in the range of
12.0 to 24.0 mm Hg. When the circulation of fluid in the eye is blocked, it can lead to a buildup in pressure, a
condition called glaucoma. The net pressure can become as great as 85.0 mm Hg, an abnormally large pressure
476   11 • Fluid Statics



      that can permanently damage the optic nerve. To get an idea of the force involved, suppose the back of the eye has
      an area of       , and the net pressure is 85.0 mm Hg. Force is given by           . To get in newtons, we convert
      the area to   (                  ). Then we calculate as follows:

                                                                                                                                         11.55


        Eye Pressure
        The shape of the eye is maintained by fluid pressure, called intraocular pressure. When the circulation of fluid in
        the eye is blocked, it can lead to a buildup in pressure, a condition called glaucoma. The force is calculated as

                                                                                                                                     11.56


      This force is the weight of about a 680-g mass. A mass of 680 g resting on the eye (imagine 1.5 lb resting on your
      eye) would be sufficient to cause it damage. (A normal force here would be the weight of about 120 g, less than one-
      quarter of our initial value.)

      People over 40 years of age are at greatest risk of developing glaucoma and should have their intraocular pressure
      tested routinely. Most measurements involve exerting a force on the (anesthetized) eye over some area (a pressure)
      and observing the eye’s response. A noncontact approach uses a puff of air and a measurement is made of the force
      needed to indent the eye (Figure 11.35). If the intraocular pressure is high, the eye will deform less and rebound
      more vigorously than normal. Excessive intraocular pressures can be detected reliably and sometimes controlled
      effectively.

      Calculating Gauge Pressure and Depth: Damage to the Eardrum
      Suppose a 3.00-N force can rupture an eardrum. (a) If the eardrum has an area of         , calculate the maximum
      tolerable gauge pressure on the eardrum in newtons per meter squared and convert it to millimeters of mercury. (b)
      At what depth in freshwater would this person’s eardrum rupture, assuming the gauge pressure in the middle ear is

      gauge pressure.

We now need to convert this to units of mm Hg:

                                                                                                                                  11.58

Here we will use the fact that the water pressure varies linearly with depth               below the surface.

Solution for (b)

           and therefore                . Using the value above for       , we have

Discussion

Similarly, increased pressure exerted upon the eardrum from the middle ear can arise when an infection causes a
fluid buildup.


Pressure Associated with the Lungs
The pressure inside the lungs increases and decreases with each breath. The pressure drops to below atmospheric
pressure (negative gauge pressure) when you inhale, causing air to flow into the lungs. It increases above
atmospheric pressure (positive gauge pressure) when you exhale, forcing air out.

Lung pressure is controlled by several mechanisms. Muscle action in the diaphragm and rib cage is necessary for
inhalation; this muscle action increases the volume of the lungs thereby reducing the pressure within them Figure
11.36. Surface tension in the alveoli creates a positive pressure opposing inhalation. (See Cohesion and Adhesion in
Liquids: Surface Tension and Capillary Action.) You can exhale without muscle action by letting surface tension in
the alveoli create its own positive pressure. Muscle action can add to this positive pressure to produce forced
exhalation, such as when you blow up a balloon, blow out a candle, or cough.

The lungs, in fact, would collapse due to the surface tension in the alveoli, if they were not attached to the inside of
the chest wall by liquid adhesion. The gauge pressure in the liquid attaching the lungs to the inside of the chest wall
is thus negative, ranging from      to            during exhalation and inhalation, respectively. If air is allowed to
enter the chest cavity, it breaks the attachment, and one or both lungs may collapse. Suction is applied to the chest
cavity of surgery patients and trauma victims to reestablish negative pressure and inflate the lungs.




FIGURE 11.36 (a) During inhalation, muscles expand the chest, and the diaphragm moves downward, reducing pressure inside the lungs to
less than atmospheric (negative gauge pressure). Pressure between the lungs and chest wall is even lower to overcome the positive
pressure created by surface tension in the lungs. (b) During gentle exhalation, the muscles simply relax and surface tension in the alveoli
creates a positive pressure inside the lungs, forcing air out. Pressure between the chest wall and lungs remains negative to keep them
attached to the chest wall, but it is less negative than during inhalation.

      Other Pressures in the Body
      Spinal Column and Skull
      Normally, there is a 5- to12-mm Hg pressure in the fluid surrounding the brain and filling the spinal column. This
      cerebrospinal fluid serves many purposes, one of which is to supply flotation to the brain. The buoyant force
      supplied by the fluid nearly equals the weight of the brain, since their densities are nearly equal. If there is a loss of
      fluid, the brain rests on the inside of the skull, causing severe headaches, constricted blood flow, and serious
      damage. Spinal fluid pressure is measured by means of a needle inserted between vertebrae that transmits the
      pressure to a suitable measuring device.

      Bladder Pressure
      This bodily pressure is one of which we are often aware. In fact, there is a relationship between our awareness of
      this pressure and a subsequent increase in it. Bladder pressure climbs steadily from zero to about 25 mm Hg as the
      bladder fills to its normal capacity of          . This pressure triggers the micturition reflex, which stimulates the
      feeling of needing to urinate. What is more, it also causes muscles around the bladder to contract, raising the
      pressure to over 100 mm Hg, accentuating the sensation. Coughing, straining, tensing in cold weather, wearing tight
      clothes, and experiencing simple nervous tension all can increase bladder pressure and trigger this reflex. So can
      the weight of a pregnant woman’s fetus, especially if it is kicking vigorously or pushing down with its head! Bladder
      pressure can be measured by a catheter or by inserting a needle through the bladder wall and transmitting the
      pressure to an appropriate measuring device. One hazard of high bladder pressure (sometimes created by an
      obstruction), is that such pressure can force urine back into the kidneys, causing potentially severe damage.

      Pressures in the Skeletal System
      These pressures are the largest in the body, due both to the high values of initial force, and the small areas to which
      this force is applied, such as in the joints.. For example, when a person lifts an object improperly, a force of 5000 N
      may be created between vertebrae in the spine, and this may be applied to an area as small as               . The
      pressure created is                                                           or about 50 atm! This pressure can
      damage both the spinal discs (the cartilage between vertebrae), as well as the bony vertebrae themselves. Even
      under normal circumstances, forces between vertebrae in the spine are large enough to create pressures of several
      atmospheres. Most causes of excessive pressure in the skeletal system can be avoided by lifting properly and
      avoiding extreme physical activity. (See Forces and Torques in Muscles and Joints.)

      There are many other interesting and medically significant pressures in the body. For example, pressure caused by
      various muscle actions drives food and waste through the digestive system. Stomach pressure behaves much like
      bladder pressure and is tied to the sensation of hunger. Pressure in the relaxed esophagus is normally negative
      because pressure in the chest cavity is normally negative. Positive pressure in the stomach may thus force acid into
      the esophagus, causing “heartburn.” Pressure in the middle ear can result in significant force on the eardrum if it
      differs greatly from atmospheric pressure, such as while scuba diving. The decrease in external pressure is also
      noticeable during plane flights (due to a decrease in the weight of air above relative to that at the Earth’s surface).
      The Eustachian tubes connect the middle ear to the throat and allow us to equalize pressure in the middle ear to
      avoid an imbalance of force on the eardrum.

      Many pressures in the human body are associated with the flow of fluids. Fluid flow will be discussed in detail in the
      Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications.

INTRODUCTION TO FLUID DYNAMICS AND ITS BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL APPLICATIONS We have dealt with
many situations in which fluids are static. But by their very definition, fluids flow. Examples come easily—a column
of smoke rises from a camp fire, water streams from a fire hose, blood courses through your veins. Why does rising
smoke curl and twist? How does a nozzle increase the speed of water emerging from a hose? How does the body
regulate blood flow? The physics of fluids in motion—fluid dynamics—allows us to answer these and many other
questions.

      12.1 Flow Rate and Its Relation to Velocity
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Calculate flow rate.
       • Define units of volume.
       • Describe incompressible fluids.
       • Explain the consequences of the equation of continuity.

      Flow rate is defined to be the volume of fluid passing by some location through an area during a period of time, as
      seen in Figure 12.2. In symbols, this can be written as

                                                                                                                                          12.1

      where      is the volume and is the elapsed time.

      The SI unit for flow rate is    , but a number of other units for are in common use. For example, the heart of a
      resting adult pumps blood at a rate of 5.00 liters per minute (L/min). Note that a liter (L) is 1/1000 of a cubic meter
      or 1000 cubic centimeters (            or          ). In this text we shall use whatever metric units are most
      convenient for a given situation.




      FIGURE 12.2 Flow rate is the volume of fluid per unit time flowing past a point through the area . Here the shaded cylinder of fluid flows
      past point in a uniform pipe in time . The volume of the cylinder is     and the average velocity is       so that the flow rate is
                      .


              EXAMPLE 12.1

      Calculating Volume from Flow Rate: The Heart Pumps a Lot of Blood in a Lifetime
      How many cubic meters of blood does the heart pump in a 75-year lifetime, assuming the average flow rate is 5.00
      L/min?

      Strategy

      Time and flow rate        are given, and so the volume          can be calculated from the definition of flow rate.

      Solution

      Solving             for volume gives
                                                                                                                                          12.2
      Substituting known values yields


                                                                                                                                          12.3


      Discussion

      This amount is about 200,000 tons of blood. For comparison, this value is equivalent to about 200 times the volume
      of water contained in a 6-lane 50-m lap pool.

Flow rate and velocity are related, but quite different, physical quantities. To make the distinction clear, think about
the flow rate of a river. The greater the velocity of the water, the greater the flow rate of the river. But flow rate also
depends on the size of the river. A rapid mountain stream carries far less water than the Amazon River in Brazil, for
example. The precise relationship between flow rate and velocity is
                                                                                                                                      12.4
where is the cross-sectional area and is the average velocity. This equation seems logical enough. The
relationship tells us that flow rate is directly proportional to both the magnitude of the average velocity (hereafter
referred to as the speed) and the size of a river, pipe, or other conduit. The larger the conduit, the greater its cross-
sectional area. Figure 12.2 illustrates how this relationship is obtained. The shaded cylinder has a volume
                                                                                                                                      12.5
which flows past the point         in a time . Dividing both sides of this relationship by gives

                                                                                                                                      12.6

We note that               and the average speed is                . Thus the equation becomes                    .

Figure 12.3 shows an incompressible fluid flowing along a pipe of decreasing radius. Because the fluid is
incompressible, the same amount of fluid must flow past any point in the tube in a given time to ensure continuity of
flow. In this case, because the cross-sectional area of the pipe decreases, the velocity must necessarily increase.
This logic can be extended to say that the flow rate must be the same at all points along the pipe. In particular, for
points 1 and 2,

                                                                                                                                      12.7

This is called the equation of continuity and is valid for any incompressible fluid. The consequences of the equation
of continuity can be observed when water flows from a hose into a narrow spray nozzle: it emerges with a large
speed—that is the purpose of the nozzle. Conversely, when a river empties into one end of a reservoir, the water
slows considerably, perhaps picking up speed again when it leaves the other end of the reservoir. In other words,
speed increases when cross-sectional area decreases, and speed decreases when cross-sectional area increases.




FIGURE 12.3 When a tube narrows, the same volume occupies a greater length. For the same volume to pass points 1 and 2 in a given time,
the speed must be greater at point 2. The process is exactly reversible. If the fluid flows in the opposite direction, its speed will decrease
when the tube widens. (Note that the relative volumes of the two cylinders and the corresponding velocity vector arrows are not drawn to
scale.)

Since liquids are essentially incompressible, the equation of continuity is valid for all liquids. However, gases are
compressible, and so the equation must be applied with caution to gases if they are subjected to compression or
expansion.


        EXAMPLE 12.2

Calculating Fluid Speed: Speed Increases When a Tube Narrows
A nozzle with a radius of 0.250 cm is attached to a garden hose with a radius of 0.900 cm. The flow rate through
hose and nozzle is 0.500 L/s. Calculate the speed of the water (a) in the hose and (b) in the nozzle.
492   12 • Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications



      Strategy

      We can use the relationship between flow rate and speed to find both velocities. We will use the subscript 1 for the
      hose and 2 for the nozzle.

      Solution for (a)

      First, we solve           for       and note that the cross-sectional area is         , yielding

                                                                                                                            12.8

      Substituting known values and making appropriate unit conversions yields

                                                                                                                            12.9


      Solution for (b)

      We could repeat this calculation to find the speed in the nozzle        , but we will use the equation of continuity to give
      a somewhat different insight. Using the equation which states
                                                                                                                           12.10

      solving for      and substituting       for the cross-sectional area yields


                                                                                                                           12.11


      Substituting known values,

                                                                                                                           12.12

      Discussion

      A speed of 1.96 m/s is about right for water emerging from a nozzleless hose. The nozzle produces a considerably
      faster stream merely by constricting the flow to a narrower tube.


      The solution to the last part of the example shows that speed is inversely proportional to the square of the radius of
      the tube, making for large effects when radius varies. We can blow out a candle at quite a distance, for example, by
      pursing our lips, whereas blowing on a candle with our mouth wide open is quite ineffective.

      In many situations, including in the cardiovascular system, branching of the flow occurs. The blood is pumped from
      the heart into arteries that subdivide into smaller arteries (arterioles) which branch into very fine vessels called
      capillaries. In this situation, continuity of flow is maintained but it is the sum of the flow rates in each of the
      branches in any portion along the tube that is maintained. The equation of continuity in a more general form
      becomes
                                                                                                                           12.13
      where      and      are the number of branches in each of the sections along the tube.

      Calculating Flow Speed and Vessel Diameter: Branching in the Cardiovascular System
      The aorta is the principal blood vessel through which blood leaves the heart in order to circulate around the body. (a)
      Calculate the average speed of the blood in the aorta if the flow rate is 5.0 L/min. The aorta has a radius of 10 mm.
      (b) Blood also flows through smaller blood vessels known as capillaries. When the rate of blood flow in the aorta is

                                                                                                  12.2 • Bernoulli’s Equation   493



5.0 L/min, the speed of blood in the capillaries is about 0.33 mm/s. Given that the average diameter of a capillary is
       , calculate the number of capillaries in the blood circulatory system.

Strategy

We can use            to calculate the speed of flow in the aorta and then use the general form of the equation of
continuity to calculate the number of capillaries as all of the other variables are known.

Solution for (a)

The flow rate is given by          or           for a cylindrical vessel.

Substituting the known values (converted to units of meters and seconds) gives


                                                                                                                    12.14


Solution for (b)

Using                       , assigning the subscript 1 to the aorta and 2 to the capillaries, and solving for    (the
number of capillaries) gives                . Converting all quantities to units of meters and seconds and substituting
into the equation above gives


                                                                                                                    12.15


Discussion

Note that the speed of flow in the capillaries is considerably reduced relative to the speed in the aorta due to the
significant increase in the total cross-sectional area at the capillaries. This low speed is to allow sufficient time for
effective exchange to occur although it is equally important for the flow not to become stationary in order to avoid
the possibility of clotting. Does this large number of capillaries in the body seem reasonable? In active muscle, one
finds about 200 capillaries per         , or about           per 1 kg of muscle. For 20 kg of muscle, this amounts to
about           capillaries.


12.2 Bernoulli’s Equation
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Explain the terms in Bernoulli’s equation.
 • Explain how Bernoulli’s equation is related to conservation of energy.
 • Explain how to derive Bernoulli’s principle from Bernoulli’s equation.
 • Calculate with Bernoulli’s principle.
 • List some applications of Bernoulli’s principle.

When a fluid flows into a narrower channel, its speed increases. That means its kinetic energy also increases. Where
does that change in kinetic energy come from? The increased kinetic energy comes from the net work done on the
fluid to push it into the channel and the work done on the fluid by the gravitational force, if the fluid changes vertical
position. Recall the work-energy theorem,

                                                                                                                    12.16

There is a pressure difference when the channel narrows. This pressure difference results in a net force on the fluid:
recall that pressure times area equals force. The net work done increases the fluid’s kinetic energy. As a result, the
pressure will drop in a rapidly-moving fluid, whether or not the fluid is confined to a tube.

There are a number of common examples of pressure dropping in rapidly-moving fluids. Shower curtains have a
494   12 • Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications



      disagreeable habit of bulging into the shower stall when the shower is on. The high-velocity stream of water and air
      creates a region of lower pressure inside the shower, and standard atmospheric pressure on the other side. The
      pressure difference results in a net force inward pushing the curtain in. You may also have noticed that when
      passing a truck on the highway, your car tends to veer toward it. The reason is the same—the high velocity of the air
      between the car and the truck creates a region of lower pressure, and the vehicles are pushed together by greater
      pressure on the outside. (See Figure 12.4.) This effect was observed as far back as the mid-1800s, when it was
      found that trains passing in opposite directions tipped precariously toward one another.




      FIGURE 12.4 An overhead view of a car passing a truck on a highway. Air passing between the vehicles flows in a narrower channel and
      must increase its speed ( is greater than ), causing the pressure between them to drop ( is less than       ). Greater pressure on the
      outside pushes the car and truck together.


        Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation with a Sheet of Paper
        Hold the short edge of a sheet of paper parallel to your mouth with one hand on each side of your mouth. The
        page should slant downward over your hands. Blow over the top of the page. Describe what happens and explain
        the reason for this behavior.


      Bernoulli’s Equation
      The relationship between pressure and velocity in fluids is described quantitatively by Bernoulli’s equation, named
      after its discoverer, the Swiss scientist Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782). Bernoulli’s equation states that for an
      incompressible, frictionless fluid, the following sum is constant:

                                                                                                                                      12.17

      where is the absolute pressure, is the fluid density, is the velocity of the fluid, is the height above some
      reference point, and is the acceleration due to gravity. If we follow a small volume of fluid along its path, various
      quantities in the sum may change, but the total remains constant. Let the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to any two points
      along the path that the bit of fluid follows; Bernoulli’s equation becomes

                                                                                                                                      12.18

      Bernoulli’s equation is a form of the conservation of energy principle. Note that the second and third terms are the
      kinetic and potential energy with replaced by . In fact, each term in the equation has units of energy per unit
      volume. We can prove this for the second term by substituting             into it and gathering terms:

                                                                                                                                      12.19

      So         is the kinetic energy per unit volume. Making the same substitution into the third term in the equation, we
      find

                                                                                                  12.2 • Bernoulli’s Equation   495




                                                                                                                    12.20

so     is the gravitational potential energy per unit volume. Note that pressure has units of energy per unit
volume, too. Since            , its units are    . If we multiply these by m/m, we obtain                    , or
energy per unit volume. Bernoulli’s equation is, in fact, just a convenient statement of conservation of energy for an
incompressible fluid in the absence of friction.


  Making Connections: Conservation of Energy
  Conservation of energy applied to fluid flow produces Bernoulli’s equation. The net work done by the fluid’s
  pressure results in changes in the fluid’s    and     per unit volume. If other forms of energy are involved in
  fluid flow, Bernoulli’s equation can be modified to take these forms into account. Such forms of energy include
  thermal energy dissipated because of fluid viscosity.


The general form of Bernoulli’s equation has three terms in it, and it is broadly applicable. To understand it better,
we will look at a number of specific situations that simplify and illustrate its use and meaning.

Bernoulli’s Equation for Static Fluids
Let us first consider the very simple situation where the fluid is static—that is,              . Bernoulli’s equation in
that case is
                                                                                                                    12.21
We can further simplify the equation by taking          (we can always choose some height to be zero, just as we
often have done for other situations involving the gravitational force, and take all other heights to be relative to this).
In that case, we get
                                                                                                                    12.22
This equation tells us that, in static fluids, pressure increases with depth. As we go from point 1 to point 2 in the
fluid, the depth increases by , and consequently,           is greater than    by an amount        . In the very simplest
case,     is zero at the top of the fluid, and we get the familiar relationship         . (Recall that            and
                ) Bernoulli’s equation includes the fact that the pressure due to the weight of a fluid is      . Although
we introduce Bernoulli’s equation for fluid flow, it includes much of what we studied for static fluids in the preceding
chapter.

Bernoulli’s Principle—Bernoulli’s Equation at Constant Depth
Another important situation is one in which the fluid moves but its depth is constant—that is,             . Under that
condition, Bernoulli’s equation becomes

                                                                                                                    12.23

Situations in which fluid flows at a constant depth are so important that this equation is often called Bernoulli’s
principle. It is Bernoulli’s equation for fluids at constant depth. (Note again that this applies to a small volume of
fluid as we follow it along its path.) As we have just discussed, pressure drops as speed increases in a moving fluid.
We can see this from Bernoulli’s principle. For example, if      is greater than   in the equation, then      must be
less than     for the equality to hold.


       EXAMPLE 12.4

Calculating Pressure: Pressure Drops as a Fluid Speeds Up
In Example 12.2, we found that the speed of water in a hose increased from 1.96 m/s to 25.5 m/s going from the
hose to the nozzle. Calculate the pressure in the hose, given that the absolute pressure in the nozzle is
                  (atmospheric, as it must be) and assuming level, frictionless flow.
496   12 • Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications



      Strategy

      Level flow means constant depth, so Bernoulli’s principle applies. We use the subscript 1 for values in the hose and
      2 for those in the nozzle. We are thus asked to find  .

      Solution

      Solving Bernoulli’s principle for        yields

                                                                                                                                        12.24

      Substituting known values,



                                                                                                                                        12.25



      Discussion

      This absolute pressure in the hose is greater than in the nozzle, as expected since is greater in the nozzle. The
      pressure    in the nozzle must be atmospheric since it emerges into the atmosphere without other changes in
      conditions.


      Applications of Bernoulli’s Principle
      There are a number of devices and situations in which fluid flows at a constant height and, thus, can be analyzed
      with Bernoulli’s principle.

      Entrainment
      People have long put the Bernoulli principle to work by using reduced pressure in high-velocity fluids to move things
      about. With a higher pressure on the outside, the high-velocity fluid forces other fluids into the stream. This process
      is called entrainment. Entrainment devices have been in use since ancient times, particularly as pumps to raise
      water small heights, as in draining swamps, fields, or other low-lying areas. Some other devices that use the concept
      of entrainment are shown in Figure 12.5.




      FIGURE 12.5 Examples of entrainment devices that use increased fluid speed to create low pressures, which then entrain one fluid into
      another. (a) A Bunsen burner uses an adjustable gas nozzle, entraining air for proper combustion. (b) An atomizer uses a squeeze bulb to
      create a jet of air that entrains drops of perfume. Paint sprayers and carburetors use very similar techniques to move their respective
      liquids. (c) A common aspirator uses a high-speed stream of water to create a region of lower pressure. Aspirators may be used as suction
      pumps in dental and surgical situations or for draining a flooded basement or producing a reduced pressure in a vessel. (d) The chimney of
      a water heater is designed to entrain air into the pipe leading through the ceiling.

      Wings and Sails
      The airplane wing is a beautiful example of Bernoulli’s principle in action. Figure 12.6(a) shows the characteristic
      shape of a wing. The wing is tilted upward at a small angle and the upper surface is longer, causing air to flow faster
      over it. The pressure on top of the wing is therefore reduced, creating a net upward force or lift. (Wings can also gain
      lift by pushing air downward, utilizing the conservation of momentum principle. The deflected air molecules result in
      an upward force on the wing — Newton’s third law.) Sails also have the characteristic shape of a wing. (See Figure
      12.6(b).) The pressure on the front side of the sail,      , is lower than the pressure on the back of the sail,     .

                                                                                                                 12.2 • Bernoulli’s Equation   497



This results in a forward force and even allows you to sail into the wind.


  Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation with Two Strips of Paper
  For a good illustration of Bernoulli’s principle, make two strips of paper, each about 15 cm long and 4 cm wide.
  Hold the small end of one strip up to your lips and let it drape over your finger. Blow across the paper. What
  happens? Now hold two strips of paper up to your lips, separated by your fingers. Blow between the strips. What
  happens?


Velocity measurement
Figure 12.7 shows two devices that measure fluid velocity based on Bernoulli’s principle. The manometer in Figure
12.7(a) is connected to two tubes that are small enough not to appreciably disturb the flow. The tube facing the
oncoming fluid creates a dead spot having zero velocity (       ) in front of it, while fluid passing the other tube has
velocity . This means that Bernoulli’s principle as stated in                                becomes

                                                                                                                                     12.26




FIGURE 12.6 (a) The Bernoulli principle helps explain lift generated by a wing. (b) Sails use the same technique to generate part of their
thrust.

Thus pressure         over the second opening is reduced by                  , and so the fluid in the manometer rises by           on the
side connected to the second opening, where

                                                                                                                                     12.27

(Recall that the symbol        means “proportional to.”) Solving for            , we see that

                                                                                                                                     12.28

Figure 12.7(b) shows a version of this device that is in common use for measuring various fluid velocities; such
devices are frequently used as air speed indicators in aircraft.

      12.3 The Most General Applications of Bernoulli’s Equation
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Calculate using Torricelli’s theorem.
       • Calculate power in fluid flow.

      Torricelli’s Theorem
      Figure 12.8 shows water gushing from a large tube through a dam. What is its speed as it emerges? Interestingly, if
      resistance is negligible, the speed is just what it would be if the water fell a distance from the surface of the
      reservoir; the water’s speed is independent of the size of the opening. Let us check this out. Bernoulli’s equation
      must be used since the depth is not constant. We consider water flowing from the surface (point 1) to the tube’s
      outlet (point 2). Bernoulli’s equation as stated in previously is

                                                                                                                                         12.29

      Both     and    equal atmospheric pressure (    is atmospheric pressure because it is the pressure at the top of the
      reservoir.   must be atmospheric pressure, since the emerging water is surrounded by the atmosphere and cannot
      have a pressure different from atmospheric pressure.) and subtract out of the equation, leaving

                                                                                                                                         12.30

      Solving this equation for       , noting that the density       cancels (because the fluid is incompressible), yields

                                                                                                                                         12.31

      We let                 ; the equation then becomes

                                                                                                                                         12.32

      where is the height dropped by the water. This is simply a kinematic equation for any object falling a distance
      with negligible resistance. In fluids, this last equation is called Torricelli’s theorem. Note that the result is
      independent of the velocity’s direction, just as we found when applying conservation of energy to falling objects.

would have if it fell the distance without friction. This is an example of Torricelli’s theorem.




FIGURE 12.9 Pressure in the nozzle of this fire hose is less than at ground level for two reasons: the water has to go uphill to get to the
nozzle, and speed increases in the nozzle. In spite of its lowered pressure, the water can exert a large force on anything it strikes, by virtue
of its kinetic energy. Pressure in the water stream becomes equal to atmospheric pressure once it emerges into the air.

All preceding applications of Bernoulli’s equation involved simplifying conditions, such as constant height or
constant pressure. The next example is a more general application of Bernoulli’s equation in which pressure,

      velocity, and height all change. (See Figure 12.9.)


              EXAMPLE 12.5

      Calculating Pressure: A Fire Hose Nozzle
      Fire hoses used in major structure fires have inside diameters of 6.40 cm. Suppose such a hose carries a flow of
      40.0 L/s starting at a gauge pressure of                  . The hose goes 10.0 m up a ladder to a nozzle having an
      inside diameter of 3.00 cm. Assuming negligible resistance, what is the pressure in the nozzle?

      Strategy

      Here we must use Bernoulli’s equation to solve for the pressure, since depth is not constant.

      Solution

      Bernoulli’s equation states

                                                                                                                       12.33

      where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the initial conditions at ground level and the final conditions inside the nozzle,
      respectively. We must first find the speeds     and . Since               , we get

                                                                                                                       12.34

      Similarly, we find
                                                                                                                       12.35
      (This rather large speed is helpful in reaching the fire.) Now, taking   to be zero, we solve Bernoulli’s equation for
         :

                                                                                                                       12.36

      Substituting known values yields


                                                                                                                       12.37



      Discussion

      This value is a gauge pressure, since the initial pressure was given as a gauge pressure. Thus the nozzle pressure is
      very close to atmospheric pressure, as it must because the water exits into the atmosphere without changes in its
      conditions.


      Power in Fluid Flow
      Power is the rate at which work is done or energy in any form is used or supplied. To see the relationship of power to
      fluid flow, consider Bernoulli’s equation:

                                                                                                                       12.38

      All three terms have units of energy per unit volume, as discussed in the previous section. Now, considering units, if
      we multiply energy per unit volume by flow rate (volume per unit time), we get units of power. That is,
                        . This means that if we multiply Bernoulli’s equation by flow rate , we get power. In equation
      form, this is

                                                                                                                      12.39

Each term has a clear physical meaning. For example,     is the power supplied to a fluid, perhaps by a pump, to
give it its pressure . Similarly,      is the power supplied to a fluid to give it its kinetic energy. And  is the
power going to gravitational potential energy.


  Making Connections: Power
  Power is defined as the rate of energy transferred, or     . Fluid flow involves several types of power. Each type
  of power is identified with a specific type of energy being expended or changed in form.



       EXAMPLE 12.6

Calculating Power in a Moving Fluid
Suppose the fire hose in the previous example is fed by a pump that receives water through a hose with a 6.40-cm
diameter coming from a hydrant with a pressure of                     . What power does the pump supply to the
water?

Strategy

Here we must consider energy forms as well as how they relate to fluid flow. Since the input and output hoses have
the same diameters and are at the same height, the pump does not change the speed of the water nor its height,
and so the water’s kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy are unchanged. That means the pump only
supplies power to increase water pressure by                     (from                    to                  ).

Solution

As discussed above, the power associated with pressure is


                                                                                                                      12.40


Discussion

Such a substantial amount of power requires a large pump, such as is found on some fire trucks. (This kilowatt value
converts to about 50 hp.) The pump in this example increases only the water’s pressure. If a pump—such as the
heart—directly increases velocity and height as well as pressure, we would have to calculate all three terms to find
the power it supplies.


12.4 Viscosity and Laminar Flow; Poiseuille’s Law
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define laminar flow and turbulent flow.
 • Explain what viscosity is.
 • Calculate flow and resistance with Poiseuille’s law.
 • Explain how pressure drops due to resistance.

Laminar Flow and Viscosity
When you pour yourself a glass of juice, the liquid flows freely and quickly. But when you pour syrup on your
pancakes, that liquid flows slowly and sticks to the pitcher. The difference is fluid friction, both within the fluid itself
and between the fluid and its surroundings. We call this property of fluids viscosity. Juice has low viscosity, whereas
502   12 • Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications



      syrup has high viscosity. In the previous sections we have considered ideal fluids with little or no viscosity. In this
      section, we will investigate what factors, including viscosity, affect the rate of fluid flow.

      The precise definition of viscosity is based on laminar, or nonturbulent, flow. Before we can define viscosity, then,
      we need to define laminar flow and turbulent flow. Figure 12.10 shows both types of flow. Laminar flow is
      characterized by the smooth flow of the fluid in layers that do not mix. Turbulent flow, or turbulence, is
      characterized by eddies and swirls that mix layers of fluid together.




      FIGURE 12.10 Smoke rises smoothly for a while and then begins to form swirls and eddies. The smooth flow is called laminar flow,
      whereas the swirls and eddies typify turbulent flow. If you watch the smoke (being careful not to breathe on it), you will notice that it rises
      more rapidly when flowing smoothly than after it becomes turbulent, implying that turbulence poses more resistance to flow. (credit:
      Creativity103)

      Figure 12.11 shows schematically how laminar and turbulent flow differ. Layers flow without mixing when flow is
      laminar. When there is turbulence, the layers mix, and there are significant velocities in directions other than the
      overall direction of flow. The lines that are shown in many illustrations are the paths followed by small volumes of
      fluids. These are called streamlines. Streamlines are smooth and continuous when flow is laminar, but break up and
      mix when flow is turbulent. Turbulence has two main causes. First, any obstruction or sharp corner, such as in a
      faucet, creates turbulence by imparting velocities perpendicular to the flow. Second, high speeds cause turbulence.
      The drag both between adjacent layers of fluid and between the fluid and its surroundings forms swirls and eddies,
      if the speed is great enough. We shall concentrate on laminar flow for the remainder of this section, leaving certain
      aspects of turbulence for later sections.




      FIGURE 12.11 (a) Laminar flow occurs in layers without mixing. Notice that viscosity causes drag between layers as well as with the fixed
      surface. (b) An obstruction in the vessel produces turbulence. Turbulent flow mixes the fluid. There is more interaction, greater heating, and
      more resistance than in laminar flow.

  Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment: Go Down to the River
  Try dropping simultaneously two sticks into a flowing river, one near the edge of the river and one near the
  middle. Which one travels faster? Why?


Figure 12.12 shows how viscosity is measured for a fluid. Two parallel plates have the specific fluid between them.
The bottom plate is held fixed, while the top plate is moved to the right, dragging fluid with it. The layer (or lamina)
of fluid in contact with either plate does not move relative to the plate, and so the top layer moves at while the
bottom layer remains at rest. Each successive layer from the top down exerts a force on the one below it, trying to
drag it along, producing a continuous variation in speed from to 0 as shown. Care is taken to insure that the flow is
laminar; that is, the layers do not mix. The motion in Figure 12.12 is like a continuous shearing motion. Fluids have
zero shear strength, but the rate at which they are sheared is related to the same geometrical factors and as is
shear deformation for solids.




FIGURE 12.12 The graphic shows laminar flow of fluid between two plates of area   . The bottom plate is fixed. When the top plate is
pushed to the right, it drags the fluid along with it.

A force is required to keep the top plate in Figure 12.12 moving at a constant velocity , and experiments have
shown that this force depends on four factors. First, is directly proportional to (until the speed is so high that
turbulence occurs—then a much larger force is needed, and it has a more complicated dependence on ). Second,
is proportional to the area of the plate. This relationship seems reasonable, since is directly proportional to the
amount of fluid being moved. Third, is inversely proportional to the distance between the plates . This
relationship is also reasonable; is like a lever arm, and the greater the lever arm, the less force that is needed.
Fourth, is directly proportional to the coefficient of viscosity, . The greater the viscosity, the greater the force
required. These dependencies are combined into the equation

                                                                                                                                 12.41

which gives us a working definition of fluid viscosity . Solving for          gives

                                                                                                                                 12.42

which defines viscosity in terms of how it is measured. The SI unit of viscosity is
                                      . Table 12.1 lists the coefficients of viscosity for various fluids.

Viscosity varies from one fluid to another by several orders of magnitude. As you might expect, the viscosities of
gases are much less than those of liquids, and these viscosities are often temperature dependent. The viscosity of
blood can be reduced by aspirin consumption, allowing it to flow more easily around the body. (When used over the
long term in low doses, aspirin can help prevent heart attacks, and reduce the risk of blood clotting.)

Laminar Flow Confined to Tubes—Poiseuille’s Law
What causes flow? The answer, not surprisingly, is pressure difference. In fact, there is a very simple relationship
between horizontal flow and pressure. Flow rate is in the direction from high to low pressure. The greater the
pressure differential between two points, the greater the flow rate. This relationship can be stated as
504   12 • Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications




                                                                                                                                            12.43

      where     and     are the pressures at two points, such as at either end of a tube, and is the resistance to flow.
      The resistance includes everything, except pressure, that affects flow rate. For example, is greater for a long
      tube than for a short one. The greater the viscosity of a fluid, the greater the value of . Turbulence greatly
      increases , whereas increasing the diameter of a tube decreases .

      If viscosity is zero, the fluid is frictionless and the resistance to flow is also zero. Comparing frictionless flow in a
      tube to viscous flow, as in Figure 12.13, we see that for a viscous fluid, speed is greatest at midstream because of
      drag at the boundaries. We can see the effect of viscosity in a Bunsen burner flame, even though the viscosity of
      natural gas is small.

      The resistance to laminar flow of an incompressible fluid having viscosity                     through a horizontal tube of uniform
      radius and length , such as the one in Figure 12.14, is given by

                                                                                                                                            12.44

      This equation is called Poiseuille’s law for resistance after the French scientist J. L. Poiseuille (1799–1869), who
      derived it in an attempt to understand the flow of blood, an often turbulent fluid.




      FIGURE 12.13 (a) If fluid flow in a tube has negligible resistance, the speed is the same all across the tube. (b) When a viscous fluid flows
      through a tube, its speed at the walls is zero, increasing steadily to its maximum at the center of the tube. (c) The shape of the Bunsen
      burner flame is due to the velocity profile across the tube. (credit: Jason Woodhead)

      Let us examine Poiseuille’s expression for to see if it makes good intuitive sense. We see that resistance is directly
      proportional to both fluid viscosity and the length of a tube. After all, both of these directly affect the amount of
      friction encountered—the greater either is, the greater the resistance and the smaller the flow. The radius of a tube
      affects the resistance, which again makes sense, because the greater the radius, the greater the flow (all other
      factors remaining the same). But it is surprising that is raised to the fourth power in Poiseuille’s law. This exponent
      means that any change in the radius of a tube has a very large effect on resistance. For example, doubling the radius
      of a tube decreases resistance by a factor of          .

      Taken together,                    and               give the following expression for flow rate:


                                                                                                                                            12.45

      This equation describes laminar flow through a tube. It is sometimes called Poiseuille’s law for laminar flow, or
      simply Poiseuille’s law.

       EXAMPLE 12.7

Using Flow Rate: Plaque Deposits Reduce Blood Flow
Suppose the flow rate of blood in a coronary artery has been reduced to half its normal value by plaque deposits. By
what factor has the radius of the artery been reduced, assuming no turbulence occurs?

Strategy

Assuming laminar flow, Poiseuille’s law states that

                                                                                                                      12.46

We need to compare the artery radius before and after the flow rate reduction.

Solution

With a constant pressure difference assumed and the same length and viscosity, along the artery we have

                                                                                                                      12.47

So, given that              , we find that                 .

Therefore,                                  , a decrease in the artery radius of 16%.

Discussion

This decrease in radius is surprisingly small for this situation. To restore the blood flow in spite of this buildup would
require an increase in the pressure difference               of a factor of two, with subsequent strain on the heart.

      The circulatory system provides many examples of Poiseuille’s law in action—with blood flow regulated by changes
      in vessel size and blood pressure. Blood vessels are not rigid but elastic. Adjustments to blood flow are primarily
      made by varying the size of the vessels, since the resistance is so sensitive to the radius. During vigorous exercise,
      blood vessels are selectively dilated to important muscles and organs and blood pressure increases. This creates
      both greater overall blood flow and increased flow to specific areas. Conversely, decreases in vessel radii, perhaps

      1 The ratios of the viscosities of blood to water are nearly constant between 0°C and 37°C.

from plaques in the arteries, can greatly reduce blood flow. If a vessel’s radius is reduced by only 5% (to 0.95 of its
original value), the flow rate is reduced to about                of its original value. A 19% decrease in flow is
caused by a 5% decrease in radius. The body may compensate by increasing blood pressure by 19%, but this
presents hazards to the heart and any vessel that has weakened walls. Another example comes from automobile
engine oil. If you have a car with an oil pressure gauge, you may notice that oil pressure is high when the engine is
cold. Motor oil has greater viscosity when cold than when warm, and so pressure must be greater to pump the same
amount of cold oil.




FIGURE 12.14 Poiseuille’s law applies to laminar flow of an incompressible fluid of viscosity through a tube of length and radius . The
direction of flow is from greater to lower pressure. Flow rate is directly proportional to the pressure difference       , and inversely
proportional to the length of the tube and viscosity of the fluid. Flow rate increases with , the fourth power of the radius.


        EXAMPLE 12.8

What Pressure Produces This Flow Rate?
An intravenous (IV) system is supplying saline solution to a patient at the rate of           through a needle of
radius 0.150 mm and length 2.50 cm. What pressure is needed at the entrance of the needle to cause this flow,
assuming the viscosity of the saline solution to be the same as that of water? The gauge pressure of the blood in the
patient’s vein is 8.00 mm Hg. (Assume that the temperature is         .)

Strategy

Assuming laminar flow, Poiseuille’s law applies. This is given by

                                                                                                                                 12.48

where       is the pressure at the entrance of the needle and             is the pressure in the vein. The only unknown is            .

Solution

Solving for      yields

                                                                                                                                 12.49

    is given as 8.00 mm Hg, which converts to                                . Substituting this and the other known values
yields


                                                                                                                                 12.50


Discussion

This pressure could be supplied by an IV bottle with the surface of the saline solution 1.61 m above the entrance to
the needle (this is left for you to solve in this chapter’s Problems and Exercises), assuming that there is negligible
pressure drop in the tubing leading to the needle.

      Flow and Resistance as Causes of Pressure Drops
      You may have noticed that water pressure in your home might be lower than normal on hot summer days when
      there is more use. This pressure drop occurs in the water main before it reaches your home. Let us consider flow
      through the water main as illustrated in Figure 12.15. We can understand why the pressure      to the home drops
      during times of heavy use by rearranging

                                                                                                                                            12.51

                                                                                                                                            12.52
      where, in this case,     is the pressure at the water works and is the resistance of the water main. During times of
      heavy use, the flow rate is large. This means that             must also be large. Thus   must decrease. It is
      correct to think of flow and resistance as causing the pressure to drop from     to   .               is valid for
      both laminar and turbulent flows.




      FIGURE 12.15 During times of heavy use, there is a significant pressure drop in a water main, and      supplied to users is significantly less
      than  created at the water works. If the flow is very small, then the pressure drop is negligible, and          .

      We can use                   to analyze pressure drops occurring in more complex systems in which the tube radius
      is not the same everywhere. Resistance will be much greater in narrow places, such as an obstructed coronary
      artery. For a given flow rate , the pressure drop will be greatest where the tube is most narrow. This is how water
      faucets control flow. Additionally, is greatly increased by turbulence, and a constriction that creates turbulence
      greatly reduces the pressure downstream. Plaque in an artery reduces pressure and hence flow, both by its
      resistance and by the turbulence it creates.

      Figure 12.16 is a schematic of the human circulatory system, showing average blood pressures in its major parts for
      an adult at rest. Pressure created by the heart’s two pumps, the right and left ventricles, is reduced by the
      resistance of the blood vessels as the blood flows through them. The left ventricle increases arterial blood pressure
      that drives the flow of blood through all parts of the body except the lungs. The right ventricle receives the lower
      pressure blood from two major veins and pumps it through the lungs for gas exchange with atmospheric gases – the
      disposal of carbon dioxide from the blood and the replenishment of oxygen. Only one major organ is shown
      schematically, with typical branching of arteries to ever smaller vessels, the smallest of which are the capillaries,
      and rejoining of small veins into larger ones. Similar branching takes place in a variety of organs in the body, and the
      circulatory system has considerable flexibility in flow regulation to these organs by the dilation and constriction of
      the arteries leading to them and the capillaries within them. The sensitivity of flow to tube radius makes this
      flexibility possible over a large range of flow rates.

FIGURE 12.16 Schematic of the circulatory system. Pressure difference is created by the two pumps in the heart and is reduced by
resistance in the vessels. Branching of vessels into capillaries allows blood to reach individual cells and exchange substances, such as
oxygen and waste products, with them. The system has an impressive ability to regulate flow to individual organs, accomplished largely by
varying vessel diameters.

Each branching of larger vessels into smaller vessels increases the total cross-sectional area of the tubes through
which the blood flows. For example, an artery with a cross section of          may branch into 20 smaller arteries,
each with cross sections of          , with a total of       . In that manner, the resistance of the branchings is
reduced so that pressure is not entirely lost. Moreover, because             and increases through branching, the
average velocity of the blood in the smaller vessels is reduced. The blood velocity in the aorta (                 ) is
about 25 cm/s, while in the capillaries (       in diameter) the velocity is about 1 mm/s. This reduced velocity
allows the blood to exchange substances with the cells in the capillaries and alveoli in particular.

12.5 The Onset of Turbulence
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Calculate Reynolds number.
 • Use the Reynolds number for a system to determine whether it is laminar or turbulent.

Sometimes we can predict if flow will be laminar or turbulent. We know that flow in a very smooth tube or around a
smooth, streamlined object will be laminar at low velocity. We also know that at high velocity, even flow in a smooth
tube or around a smooth object will experience turbulence. In between, it is more difficult to predict. In fact, at
intermediate velocities, flow may oscillate back and forth indefinitely between laminar and turbulent.

An occlusion, or narrowing, of an artery, such as shown in Figure 12.17, is likely to cause turbulence because of the
irregularity of the blockage, as well as the complexity of blood as a fluid. Turbulence in the circulatory system is
noisy and can sometimes be detected with a stethoscope, such as when measuring diastolic pressure in the upper
arm’s partially collapsed brachial artery. These turbulent sounds, at the onset of blood flow when the cuff pressure
becomes sufficiently small, are called Korotkoff sounds. Aneurysms, or ballooning of arteries, create significant
turbulence and can sometimes be detected with a stethoscope. Heart murmurs, consistent with their name, are
sounds produced by turbulent flow around damaged and insufficiently closed heart valves. Ultrasound can also be
510   12 • Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications



      used to detect turbulence as a medical indicator in a process analogous to Doppler-shift radar used to detect
      storms.




      FIGURE 12.17 Flow is laminar in the large part of this blood vessel and turbulent in the part narrowed by plaque, where velocity is high. In
      the transition region, the flow can oscillate chaotically between laminar and turbulent flow.

      An indicator called the Reynolds number      can reveal whether flow is laminar or turbulent. For flow in a tube of
      uniform diameter, the Reynolds number is defined as

                                                                                                                                          12.53

      where is the fluid density, its speed, its viscosity, and the tube radius. The Reynolds number is a unitless
      quantity. Experiments have revealed that        is related to the onset of turbulence. For     below about 2000, flow
      is laminar. For     above about 3000, flow is turbulent. For values of        between about 2000 and 3000, flow is
      unstable—that is, it can be laminar, but small obstructions and surface roughness can make it turbulent, and it may
      oscillate randomly between being laminar and turbulent. The blood flow through most of the body is a quiet, laminar
      flow. The exception is in the aorta, where the speed of the blood flow rises above a critical value of 35 m/s and
      becomes turbulent.


              EXAMPLE 12.9

      Is This Flow Laminar or Turbulent?
      Calculate the Reynolds number for flow in the needle considered in Example 12.8 to verify the assumption that the
      flow is laminar. Assume that the density of the saline solution is        .

      We have all of the information needed, except the fluid speed , which can be calculated from
      (verification of this is in this chapter’s Problems and Exercises).

      Entering the known values into                       gives

      Discussion

      Since       is well below 2000, the flow should indeed be laminar.

 Take-Home Experiment: Inhalation
 Under the conditions of normal activity, an adult inhales about 1 L of air during each inhalation. With the aid of a
 watch, determine the time for one of your own inhalations by timing several breaths and dividing the total length
 by the number of breaths. Calculate the average flow rate of air traveling through the trachea during each
 inhalation.


The topic of chaos has become quite popular over the last few decades. A system is defined to be chaotic when its
behavior is so sensitive to some factor that it is extremely difficult to predict. The field of chaos is the study of
chaotic behavior. A good example of chaotic behavior is the flow of a fluid with a Reynolds number between 2000
and 3000. Whether or not the flow is turbulent is difficult, but not impossible, to predict—the difficulty lies in the
extremely sensitive dependence on factors like roughness and obstructions on the nature of the flow. A tiny
variation in one factor has an exaggerated (or nonlinear) effect on the flow. Phenomena as disparate as turbulence,
the orbit of Pluto, and the onset of irregular heartbeats are chaotic and can be analyzed with similar techniques.

12.6 Motion of an Object in a Viscous Fluid
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Calculate the Reynolds number for an object moving through a fluid.
 • Explain whether the Reynolds number indicates laminar or turbulent flow.
 • Describe the conditions under which an object has a terminal speed.

A moving object in a viscous fluid is equivalent to a stationary object in a flowing fluid stream. (For example, when
you ride a bicycle at 10 m/s in still air, you feel the air in your face exactly as if you were stationary in a 10-m/s
wind.) Flow of the stationary fluid around a moving object may be laminar, turbulent, or a combination of the two.
Just as with flow in tubes, it is possible to predict when a moving object creates turbulence. We use another form of
the Reynolds number        , defined for an object moving in a fluid to be

                                                                                                                       12.55

where is a characteristic length of the object (a sphere’s diameter, for example), the fluid density, its viscosity,
and the object’s speed in the fluid. If    is less than about 1, flow around the object can be laminar, particularly if
the object has a smooth shape. The transition to turbulent flow occurs for           between 1 and about 10, depending
on surface roughness and so on. Depending on the surface, there can be a turbulent wake behind the object with
some laminar flow over its surface. For an  between 10 and        , the flow may be either laminar or turbulent and
may oscillate between the two. For        greater than about        , the flow is entirely turbulent, even at the surface of
the object. (See Figure 12.18.) Laminar flow occurs mostly when the objects in the fluid are small, such as
raindrops, pollen, and blood cells in plasma.

Does a Ball Have a Turbulent Wake?
Calculate the Reynolds number          for a ball with a 7.40-cm diameter thrown at 40.0 m/s.

Strategy

We can use              to calculate        , since all values in it are either given or can be found in tables of density
and viscosity.

Solution

Substituting values into the equation for        yields

                                                                                                                                               12.56


      Discussion

      This value is sufficiently high to imply a turbulent wake. Most large objects, such as airplanes and sailboats, create
      significant turbulence as they move. As noted before, the Bernoulli principle gives only qualitatively-correct results
      in such situations.


      One of the consequences of viscosity is a resistance force called viscous drag       that is exerted on a moving
      object. This force typically depends on the object’s speed (in contrast with simple friction). Experiments have shown
      that for laminar flow (      less than about one) viscous drag is proportional to speed, whereas for      between
      about 10 and      , viscous drag is proportional to speed squared. (This relationship is a strong dependence and is
      pertinent to bicycle racing, where even a small headwind causes significantly increased drag on the racer. Cyclists
      take turns being the leader in the pack for this reason.) For   greater than      , drag increases dramatically and
      behaves with greater complexity. For laminar flow around a sphere,         is proportional to fluid viscosity , the
      object’s characteristic size , and its speed . All of which makes sense—the more viscous the fluid and the larger
      the object, the more drag we expect. Recall Stoke’s law                . For the special case of a small sphere of radius
        moving slowly in a fluid of viscosity , the drag force    is given by
                                                                                                                                               12.57




      FIGURE 12.18 (a) Motion of this sphere to the right is equivalent to fluid flow to the left. Here the flow is laminar with       less than 1. There
      is a force, called viscous drag   , to the left on the ball due to the fluid’s viscosity. (b) At a higher speed, the flow becomes partially
      turbulent, creating a wake starting where the flow lines separate from the surface. Pressure in the wake is less than in front of the sphere,
      because fluid speed is less, creating a net force to the left     that is significantly greater than for laminar flow. Here     is greater than 10.
      (c) At much higher speeds, where        is greater than     , flow becomes turbulent everywhere on the surface and behind the sphere. Drag
      increases dramatically.

      An interesting consequence of the increase in          with speed is that an object falling through a fluid will not
      continue to accelerate indefinitely (as it would if we neglect air resistance, for example). Instead, viscous drag
      increases, slowing acceleration, until a critical speed, called the terminal speed, is reached and the acceleration of
      the object becomes zero. Once this happens, the object continues to fall at constant speed (the terminal speed).
      This is the case for particles of sand falling in the ocean, cells falling in a centrifuge, and sky divers falling through
      the air. Figure 12.19 shows some of the factors that affect terminal speed. There is a viscous drag on the object that
      depends on the viscosity of the fluid and the size of the object. But there is also a buoyant force that depends on the
      density of the object relative to the fluid. Terminal speed will be greatest for low-viscosity fluids and objects with
      high densities and small sizes. Thus a skydiver falls more slowly with outspread limbs than when they are in a pike
      position—head first with hands at their side and legs together.


        Take-Home Experiment: Don’t Lose Your Marbles
        By measuring the terminal speed of a slowly moving sphere in a viscous fluid, one can find the viscosity of that
        fluid (at that temperature). It can be difficult to find small ball bearings around the house, but a small marble will
        do. Gather two or three fluids (syrup, motor oil, honey, olive oil, etc.) and a thick, tall clear glass or vase. Drop the
        marble into the center of the fluid and time its fall (after letting it drop a little to reach its terminal speed).

  Compare your values for the terminal speed and see if they are inversely proportional to the viscosities as listed
  in Table 12.1. Does it make a difference if the marble is dropped near the side of the glass?


Knowledge of terminal speed is useful for estimating sedimentation rates of small particles. We know from watching
mud settle out of dirty water that sedimentation is usually a slow process. Centrifuges are used to speed
sedimentation by creating accelerated frames in which gravitational acceleration is replaced by centripetal
acceleration, which can be much greater, increasing the terminal speed.

Processes
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define diffusion, osmosis, dialysis, and active transport.
 • Calculate diffusion rates.

Diffusion
There is something fishy about the ice cube from your freezer—how did it pick up those food odors? How does
soaking a sprained ankle in Epsom salt reduce swelling? The answer to these questions are related to atomic and
molecular transport phenomena—another mode of fluid motion. Atoms and molecules are in constant motion at any
temperature. In fluids they move about randomly even in the absence of macroscopic flow. This motion is called a
random walk and is illustrated in Figure 12.20. Diffusion is the movement of substances due to random thermal
molecular motion. Fluids, like fish fumes or odors entering ice cubes, can even diffuse through solids.

Diffusion is a slow process over macroscopic distances. The densities of common materials are great enough that
molecules cannot travel very far before having a collision that can scatter them in any direction, including straight
backward. It can be shown that the average distance         that a molecule travels is proportional to the square root
of time:

                                                                                                                                    12.58

where         stands for the root-mean-square distance and is the statistical average for the process. The quantity
is the diffusion constant for the particular molecule in a specific medium. Table 12.2 lists representative values of
for various substances, in units of       .

      Note that gets progressively smaller for more massive molecules. This decrease is because the average
      molecular speed at a given temperature is inversely proportional to molecular mass. Thus the more massive
      molecules diffuse more slowly. Another interesting point is that for oxygen in air is much greater than for
      oxygen in water. In water, an oxygen molecule makes many more collisions in its random walk and is slowed
      considerably. In water, an oxygen molecule moves only about            in 1 s. (Each molecule actually collides about
           times per second!). Finally, note that diffusion constants increase with temperature, because average
      molecular speed increases with temperature. This is because the average kinetic energy of molecules,             , is
      proportional to absolute temperature.

Discussion

This is a remarkably long time for glucose to move a mere centimeter! For this reason, we stir sugar into water rather
than waiting for it to diffuse.


Because diffusion is typically very slow, its most important effects occur over small distances. For example, the
cornea of the eye gets most of its oxygen by diffusion through the thin tear layer covering it.

The Rate and Direction of Diffusion
If you very carefully place a drop of food coloring in a still glass of water, it will slowly diffuse into the colorless
surroundings until its concentration is the same everywhere. This type of diffusion is called free diffusion, because
there are no barriers inhibiting it. Let us examine its direction and rate. Molecular motion is random in direction, and
so simple chance dictates that more molecules will move out of a region of high concentration than into it. The net
rate of diffusion is higher initially than after the process is partially completed. (See Figure 12.21.)




FIGURE 12.21 Diffusion proceeds from a region of higher concentration to a lower one. The net rate of movement is proportional to the
difference in concentration.

The net rate of diffusion is proportional to the concentration difference. Many more molecules will leave a region of
high concentration than will enter it from a region of low concentration. In fact, if the concentrations were the same,
there would be no net movement. The net rate of diffusion is also proportional to the diffusion constant , which is
determined experimentally. The farther a molecule can diffuse in a given time, the more likely it is to leave the
region of high concentration. Many of the factors that affect the rate are hidden in the diffusion constant . For
example, temperature and cohesive and adhesive forces all affect values of .

Diffusion is the dominant mechanism by which the exchange of nutrients and waste products occur between the
blood and tissue, and between air and blood in the lungs. In the evolutionary process, as organisms became larger,
they needed quicker methods of transportation than net diffusion, because of the larger distances involved in the
transport, leading to the development of circulatory systems. Less sophisticated, single-celled organisms still rely
totally on diffusion for the removal of waste products and the uptake of nutrients.

      Osmosis and Dialysis—Diffusion across Membranes
      Some of the most interesting examples of diffusion occur through barriers that affect the rates of diffusion. For
      example, when you soak a swollen ankle in Epsom salt, water diffuses through your skin. Many substances regularly
      move through cell membranes; oxygen moves in, carbon dioxide moves out, nutrients go in, and wastes go out, for
      example. Because membranes are thin structures (typically              to              m across) diffusion rates
      through them can be high. Diffusion through membranes is an important method of transport.

      Membranes are generally selectively permeable, or semipermeable. (See Figure 12.22.) One type of
      semipermeable membrane has small pores that allow only small molecules to pass through. In other types of
      membranes, the molecules may actually dissolve in the membrane or react with molecules in the membrane while
      moving across. Membrane function, in fact, is the subject of much current research, involving not only physiology
      but also chemistry and physics.




      FIGURE 12.22 (a) A semipermeable membrane with small pores that allow only small molecules to pass through. (b) Certain molecules
      dissolve in this membrane and diffuse across it.

      Osmosis is the transport of water through a semipermeable membrane from a region of high concentration to a
      region of low concentration. Osmosis is driven by the imbalance in water concentration. For example, water is more
      concentrated in your body than in Epsom salt. When you soak a swollen ankle in Epsom salt, the water moves out of
      your body into the lower-concentration region in the salt. Similarly, dialysis is the transport of any other molecule
      through a semipermeable membrane due to its concentration difference. Both osmosis and dialysis are used by the
      kidneys to cleanse the blood.

      Osmosis can create a substantial pressure. Consider what happens if osmosis continues for some time, as
      illustrated in Figure 12.23. Water moves by osmosis from the left into the region on the right, where it is less
      concentrated, causing the solution on the right to rise. This movement will continue until the pressure          created
      by the extra height of fluid on the right is large enough to stop further osmosis. This pressure is called a back
      pressure. The back pressure          that stops osmosis is also called the relative osmotic pressure if neither solution
      is pure water, and it is called the osmotic pressure if one solution is pure water. Osmotic pressure can be large,
      depending on the size of the concentration difference. For example, if pure water and sea water are separated by a
      semipermeable membrane that passes no salt, osmotic pressure will be 25.9 atm. This value means that water will
      diffuse through the membrane until the salt water surface rises 268 m above the pure-water surface! One example
      of pressure created by osmosis is turgor in plants (many wilt when too dry). Turgor describes the condition of a plant
      in which the fluid in a cell exerts a pressure against the cell wall. This pressure gives the plant support. Dialysis can
      similarly cause substantial pressures.

FIGURE 12.23 (a) Two sugar-water solutions of different concentrations, separated by a semipermeable membrane that passes water but
not sugar. Osmosis will be to the right, since water is less concentrated there. (b) The fluid level rises until the back pressure equals the
relative osmotic pressure; then, the net transfer of water is zero.

Reverse osmosis and reverse dialysis (also called filtration) are processes that occur when back pressure is
sufficient to reverse the normal direction of substances through membranes. Back pressure can be created naturally
as on the right side of Figure 12.23. (A piston can also create this pressure.) Reverse osmosis can be used to
desalinate water by simply forcing it through a membrane that will not pass salt. Similarly, reverse dialysis can be
used to filter out any substance that a given membrane will not pass.

One further example of the movement of substances through membranes deserves mention. We sometimes find
that substances pass in the direction opposite to what we expect. Cypress tree roots, for example, extract pure
water from salt water, although osmosis would move it in the opposite direction. This is not reverse osmosis,
because there is no back pressure to cause it. What is happening is called active transport, a process in which a
living membrane expends energy to move substances across it. Many living membranes move water and other
substances by active transport. The kidneys, for example, not only use osmosis and dialysis—they also employ
significant active transport to move substances into and out of blood. In fact, it is estimated that at least 25% of the
body’s energy is expended on active transport of substances at the cellular level. The study of active transport
carries us into the realms of microbiology, biophysics, and biochemistry and it is a fascinating application of the laws
of nature to living structures.

INTRODUCTION TO TEMPERATURE, KINETIC THEORY, AND THE GAS LAWS Heat is something familiar to each
of us. We feel the warmth of the summer Sun, the chill of a clear summer night, the heat of coffee after a winter
stroll, and the cooling effect of our sweat. Heat transfer is maintained by temperature differences. Manifestations of
heat transfer—the movement of heat energy from one place or material to another—are apparent throughout the
universe. Heat from beneath Earth’s surface is brought to the surface in flows of incandescent lava. The Sun warms
Earth’s surface and is the source of much of the energy we find on it. Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide
threaten to trap more of the Sun’s energy, perhaps fundamentally altering the ecosphere. In space, supernovas
explode, briefly radiating more heat than an entire galaxy does.

What is heat? How do we define it? How is it related to temperature? What are heat’s effects? How is it related to
other forms of energy and to work? We will find that, in spite of the richness of the phenomena, there is a small set
of underlying physical principles that unite the subjects and tie them to other fields.

      13.1 Temperature
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define temperature.
       • Convert temperatures between the Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.
       • Define thermal equilibrium.
       • State the zeroth law of thermodynamics.

      The concept of temperature has evolved from the common concepts of hot and cold. Human perception of what
      feels hot or cold is a relative one. For example, if you place one hand in hot water and the other in cold water, and
      then place both hands in tepid water, the tepid water will feel cool to the hand that was in hot water, and warm to
      the one that was in cold water. The scientific definition of temperature is less ambiguous than your senses of hot
      and cold. Temperature is operationally defined to be what we measure with a thermometer. (Many physical
      quantities are defined solely in terms of how they are measured. We shall see later how temperature is related to
      the kinetic energies of atoms and molecules, a more physical explanation.) Two accurate thermometers, one placed
      in hot water and the other in cold water, will show the hot water to have a higher temperature. If they are then
      placed in the tepid water, both will give identical readings (within measurement uncertainties). In this section, we
      discuss temperature, its measurement by thermometers, and its relationship to thermal equilibrium. Again,
      temperature is the quantity measured by a thermometer.


        Misconception Alert: Human Perception vs. Reality
        On a cold winter morning, the wood on a porch feels warmer than the metal of your bike. The wood and bicycle
        are in thermal equilibrium with the outside air, and are thus the same temperature. They feel different because
        of the difference in the way that they conduct heat away from your skin. The metal conducts heat away from
        your body faster than the wood does (see more about conductivity in Conduction). This is just one example
        demonstrating that the human sense of hot and cold is not determined by temperature alone.

        Another factor that affects our perception of temperature is humidity. Most people feel much hotter on hot,
        humid days than on hot, dry days. This is because on humid days, sweat does not evaporate from the skin as
        efficiently as it does on dry days. It is the evaporation of sweat (or water from a sprinkler or pool) that cools us
        off.


      Any physical property that depends on temperature, and whose response to temperature is reproducible, can be
      used as the basis of a thermometer. Because many physical properties depend on temperature, the variety of
      thermometers is remarkable. For example, volume increases with temperature for most substances. This property is
      the basis for the common alcohol thermometer, the old mercury thermometer, and the bimetallic strip (Figure 13.3).
      Other properties used to measure temperature include electrical resistance and color, as shown in Figure 13.4, and
      the emission of infrared radiation, as shown in Figure 13.5.

more than the metal on the right.

accurate than alcohol thermometers placed under the tongue or in the armpit. (credit: Lamel J. Hinton/U.S. Navy)

Temperature Scales
Thermometers are used to measure temperature according to well-defined scales of measurement, which use pre-
defined reference points to help compare quantities. The three most common temperature scales are the
Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scales. A temperature scale can be created by identifying two easily reproducible
temperatures. The freezing and boiling temperatures of water at standard atmospheric pressure are commonly
used.

The Celsius scale (which replaced the slightly different centigrade scale) has the freezing point of water at      and
the boiling point at       . Its unit is the degree Celsius   . On the Fahrenheit scale (still the most frequently used
in the United States), the freezing point of water is at    and the boiling point is at       . The unit of temperature
532   13 • Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws



      on this scale is the degree Fahrenheit   . Note that a temperature difference of one degree Celsius is greater than
      a temperature difference of one degree Fahrenheit. Only 100 Celsius degrees span the same range as 180
      Fahrenheit degrees, thus one degree on the Celsius scale is 1.8 times larger than one degree on the Fahrenheit scale


      The Kelvin scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science. It is an absolute temperature scale
      defined to have 0 K at the lowest possible temperature, called absolute zero. The official temperature unit on this
      scale is the kelvin, which is abbreviated K, and is not accompanied by a degree sign. The freezing and boiling points
      of water are 273.15 K and 373.15 K, respectively. Thus, the magnitude of temperature differences is the same in
      units of kelvins and degrees Celsius. Unlike other temperature scales, the Kelvin scale is an absolute scale. It is used
      extensively in scientific work because a number of physical quantities, such as the volume of an ideal gas, are
      directly related to absolute temperature. The kelvin is the SI unit used in scientific work.

      sizes of the scales are also shown.

      The relationships between the three common temperature scales is shown in Figure 13.6. Temperatures on these
      scales can be converted using the equations in Table 13.1.

       EXAMPLE 13.2

Converting between Temperature Scales: the Reaumur Scale
The Reaumur scale is a temperature scale that was used widely in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. On the
Reaumur temperature scale, the freezing point of water is      and the boiling temperature is   . If “room
temperature” is      on the Celsius scale, what is it on the Reaumur scale?

Strategy

To answer this question, we must compare the Reaumur scale to the Celsius scale. The difference between the
freezing point and boiling point of water on the Reaumur scale is      . On the Celsius scale it is   . Therefore
               . Both scales start at for freezing, so we can derive a simple formula to convert between
temperatures on the two scales.

Solution

1. Derive a formula to convert from one scale to the other:

                                                                                                                    13.5

2. Plug the known value into the equation and solve:

      with body temperatures within a small range, from            to              to      ). The average normal body
      temperature is usually given as            (      ), and variations in this temperature can indicate a medical condition:
      a fever, an infection, a tumor, or circulatory problems (see Figure 13.7).

      The lowest temperatures ever recorded have been measured during laboratory experiments:                      at the
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA), and                 at Helsinki University of Technology (Finland). In
      comparison, the coldest recorded place on Earth’s surface is Vostok, Antarctica at 183 K         , and the coldest
      place (outside the lab) known in the universe is the Boomerang Nebula, with a temperature of 1 K.

  Making Connections: Absolute Zero
  What is absolute zero? Absolute zero is the temperature at which all molecular motion has ceased. The concept
  of absolute zero arises from the behavior of gases. Figure 13.9 shows how the pressure of gases at a constant
  volume decreases as temperature decreases. Various scientists have noted that the pressures of gases
  extrapolate to zero at the same temperature,               . This extrapolation implies that there is a lowest
  temperature. This temperature is called absolute zero. Today we know that most gases first liquefy and then
  freeze, and it is not actually possible to reach absolute zero. The numerical value of absolute zero temperature is
              or 0 K.

      zero pressure at the same temperature.

      Thermal Equilibrium and the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
      Thermometers actually take their own temperature, not the temperature of the object they are measuring. This
      raises the question of how we can be certain that a thermometer measures the temperature of the object with which
      it is in contact. It is based on the fact that any two systems placed in thermal contact (meaning heat transfer can
      occur between them) will reach the same temperature. That is, heat will flow from the hotter object to the cooler
      one until they have exactly the same temperature. The objects are then in thermal equilibrium, and no further
      changes will occur. The systems interact and change because their temperatures differ, and the changes stop once
      their temperatures are the same. Thus, if enough time is allowed for this transfer of heat to run its course, the
      temperature a thermometer registers does represent the system with which it is in thermal equilibrium. Thermal
      equilibrium is established when two bodies are in contact with each other and can freely exchange energy.

      Furthermore, experimentation has shown that if two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each another,
      and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C. This conclusion
      may seem obvious, because all three have the same temperature, but it is basic to thermodynamics. It is called the
      zeroth law of thermodynamics.


        The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
        If two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third
        system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C.


      This law was postulated in the 1930s, after the first and second laws of thermodynamics had been developed and
      named. It is called the zeroth law because it comes logically before the first and second laws (discussed in
      Thermodynamics). Suppose, for example, a cold metal block and a hot metal block are both placed on a metal plate
      at room temperature. Eventually the cold block and the plate will be in thermal equilibrium. In addition, the hot
      block and the plate will be in thermal equilibrium. By the zeroth law, we can conclude that the cold block and the hot
      block are also in thermal equilibrium.

           CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
      Does the temperature of a body depend on its size?
      Solution
      No, the system can be divided into smaller parts each of which is at the same temperature. We say that the
      temperature is an intensive quantity. Intensive quantities are independent of size.

13.2 Thermal Expansion of Solids and Liquids
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define and describe thermal expansion.
 • Calculate the linear expansion of an object given its initial length, change in temperature, and coefficient
    of linear expansion.
 • Calculate the volume expansion of an object given its initial volume, change in temperature, and
    coefficient of volume expansion.
 • Calculate thermal stress on an object given its original volume, temperature change, volume change, and
    bulk modulus.

buckling. (credit: Ingolfson, Wikimedia Commons)

The expansion of alcohol in a thermometer is one of many commonly encountered examples of thermal expansion,
the change in size or volume of a given mass with temperature. Hot air rises because its volume increases, which
causes the hot air’s density to be smaller than the density of surrounding air, causing a buoyant (upward) force on
the hot air. The same happens in all liquids and gases, driving natural heat transfer upwards in homes, oceans, and
weather systems. Solids also undergo thermal expansion. Railroad tracks and bridges, for example, have expansion
joints to allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes.

What are the basic properties of thermal expansion? First, thermal expansion is clearly related to temperature
change. The greater the temperature change, the more a bimetallic strip will bend. Second, it depends on the
material. In a thermometer, for example, the expansion of alcohol is much greater than the expansion of the glass
containing it.

What is the underlying cause of thermal expansion? As is discussed in Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular
Explanation of Pressure and Temperature, an increase in temperature implies an increase in the kinetic energy of
the individual atoms. In a solid, unlike in a gas, the atoms or molecules are closely packed together, but their kinetic
energy (in the form of small, rapid vibrations) pushes neighboring atoms or molecules apart from each other. This
neighbor-to-neighbor pushing results in a slightly greater distance, on average, between neighbors, and adds up to a
larger size for the whole body. For most substances under ordinary conditions, there is no preferred direction, and
an increase in temperature will increase the solid’s size by a certain fraction in each dimension.


  Linear Thermal Expansion—Thermal Expansion in One Dimension
  The change in length      is proportional to length . The dependence of thermal expansion on temperature,
  substance, and length is summarized in the equation
538   13 • Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws



                                                                                                                            13.7
          where    is the change in length ,       is the change in temperature, and         is the coefficient of linear
          expansion, which varies slightly with temperature.


      Table 13.2 lists representative values of the coefficient of linear expansion, which may have units of      or 1/K.
      Because the size of a kelvin and a degree Celsius are the same, both and          can be expressed in units of kelvins
      or degrees Celsius. The equation                 is accurate for small changes in temperature and can be used for
      large changes in temperature if an average value of is used.

Calculating Linear Thermal Expansion: The Golden Gate Bridge
The main span of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge is 1275 m long at its coldest. The bridge is exposed to
temperatures ranging from           to  . What is its change in length between these temperatures? Assume that
the bridge is made entirely of steel.

Discussion

Although not large compared with the length of the bridge, this change in length is observable. It is generally spread
over many expansion joints so that the expansion at each joint is small.


Thermal Expansion in Two and Three Dimensions
Objects expand in all dimensions, as illustrated in Figure 13.11. That is, their areas and volumes, as well as their
lengths, increase with temperature. Holes also get larger with temperature. If you cut a hole in a metal plate, the
remaining material will expand exactly as it would if the plug was still in place. The plug would get bigger, and so the
hole must get bigger too. (Think of the ring of neighboring atoms or molecules on the wall of the hole as pushing
each other farther apart as temperature increases. Obviously, the ring of neighbors must get slightly larger, so the
hole gets slightly larger).


 Thermal Expansion in Two Dimensions
 For small temperature changes, the change in area            is given by
                                                                                                                  13.9
540   13 • Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws



        where      is the change in area ,      is the change in temperature, and                 is the coefficient of linear expansion,
        which varies slightly with temperature.




      FIGURE 13.11 In general, objects expand in all directions as temperature increases. In these drawings, the original boundaries of the
      objects are shown with solid lines, and the expanded boundaries with dashed lines. (a) Area increases because both length and width
      increase. The area of a circular plug also increases. (b) If the plug is removed, the hole it leaves becomes larger with increasing
      temperature, just as if the expanding plug were still in place. (c) Volume also increases, because all three dimensions increase.


        Thermal Expansion in Three Dimensions
        The change in volume            is very nearly                     . This equation is usually written as
                                                                                                                                      13.10
        where is the coefficient of volume expansion and                        . Note that the values of      in Table 13.2 are almost
        exactly equal to .


      In general, objects will expand with increasing temperature. Water is the most important exception to this rule.
      Water expands with increasing temperature (its density decreases) when it is at temperatures greater than
                 . However, it expands with decreasing temperature when it is between              and           to      .
      Water is densest at        . (See Figure 13.12.) Perhaps the most striking effect of this phenomenon is the freezing of
      water in a pond. When water near the surface cools down to           it is denser than the remaining water and thus will
      sink to the bottom. This “turnover” results in a layer of warmer water near the surface, which is then cooled.
      Eventually the pond has a uniform temperature of         . If the temperature in the surface layer drops below       , the
      water is less dense than the water below, and thus stays near the top. As a result, the pond surface can completely
      freeze over. The ice on top of liquid water provides an insulating layer from winter’s harsh exterior air temperatures.
      Fish and other aquatic life can survive in     water beneath ice, due to this unusual characteristic of water. It also
      produces circulation of water in the pond that is necessary for a healthy ecosystem of the body of water.

      density at    is only 0.0075% greater than the density at     , and 0.012% greater than that at     .

 Making Connections: Real-World Connections—Filling the Tank
 Differences in the thermal expansion of materials can lead to interesting effects at the gas station. One example
 is the dripping of gasoline from a freshly filled tank on a hot day. Gasoline starts out at the temperature of the
 ground under the gas station, which is cooler than the air temperature above. The gasoline cools the steel tank
 when it is filled. Both gasoline and steel tank expand as they warm to air temperature, but gasoline expands
 much more than steel, and so it may overflow.

 This difference in expansion can also cause problems when interpreting the gasoline gauge. The actual amount
 (mass) of gasoline left in the tank when the gauge hits “empty” is a lot less in the summer than in the winter. The
 gasoline has the same volume as it does in the winter when the “add fuel” light goes on, but because the
 gasoline has expanded, there is less mass. If you are used to getting another 40 miles on “empty” in the winter,
 beware—you will probably run out much more quickly in the summer.




 FIGURE 13.13 Because the gas expands more than the gas tank with increasing temperature, you can’t drive as many miles on
 “empty” in the summer as you can in the winter. (credit: Hector Alejandro, Flickr)




       EXAMPLE 13.4

Calculating Thermal Expansion: Gas vs. Gas Tank
Suppose your 60.0-L (15.9-gal) steel gasoline tank is full of gas, so both the tank and the gasoline have a
temperature of       . How much gasoline has spilled by the time they warm to             ?

Strategy

The tank and gasoline increase in volume, but the gasoline increases more, so the amount spilled is the difference in
their volume changes. (The gasoline tank can be treated as solid steel.) We can use the equation for volume
expansion to calculate the change in volume of the gasoline and of the tank.

Solution

1. Use the equation for volume expansion to calculate the increase in volume of the steel tank:
                                                                                                                             13.11
2. The increase in volume of the gasoline is given by this equation:

                                                                                                                             13.12

3. Find the difference in volume to determine the amount spilled as

                                                                                                                             13.13

Alternatively, we can combine these three equations into a single equation. (Note that the original volumes are
equal.)

      Discussion

      This amount is significant, particularly for a 60.0-L tank. The effect is so striking because the gasoline and steel
      expand quickly. The rate of change in thermal properties is discussed in Heat and Heat Transfer Methods.

      If you try to cap the tank tightly to prevent overflow, you will find that it leaks anyway, either around the cap or by
      bursting the tank. Tightly constricting the expanding gas is equivalent to compressing it, and both liquids and solids
      resist being compressed with extremely large forces. To avoid rupturing rigid containers, these containers have air
      gaps, which allow them to expand and contract without stressing them.


      Thermal Stress
      Thermal stress is created by thermal expansion or contraction (see Elasticity: Stress and Strain for a discussion of
      stress and strain). Thermal stress can be destructive, such as when expanding gasoline ruptures a tank. It can also
      be useful, for example, when two parts are joined together by heating one in manufacturing, then slipping it over the
      other and allowing the combination to cool. Thermal stress can explain many phenomena, such as the weathering of
      rocks and pavement by the expansion of ice when it freezes.


              EXAMPLE 13.5

      Calculating Thermal Stress: Gas Pressure
      What pressure would be created in the gasoline tank considered in Example 13.4, if the gasoline increases in
      temperature from         to        without being allowed to expand? Assume that the bulk modulus for gasoline
      is                . (For more on bulk modulus, see Elasticity: Stress and Strain.)

      Strategy

      To solve this problem, we must use the following equation, which relates a change in volume          to pressure:

                                                                                                                       13.15

      where      is pressure,   is the original volume, and is the bulk modulus of the material involved. We will use the
      amount spilled in Example 13.4 as the change in volume,     .

      Solution

      1. Rearrange the equation for calculating pressure:

                                                                                                                       13.16

      2. Insert the known values. The bulk modulus for gasoline is             ×            . In the previous example, the
      change in volume                 is the amount that would spill. Here,                is the original volume of the
      gasoline. Substituting these values into the equation, we obtain

more in the summer than in the winter, and will snap in cold weather if there is insufficient slack. Cracks open and
close in plaster walls as a house warms and cools. Glass cooking pans will crack if cooled rapidly or unevenly,
because of differential contraction and the stresses it creates. (Pyrex® is less susceptible because of its small
coefficient of thermal expansion.) Nuclear reactor pressure vessels are threatened by overly rapid cooling, and
although none have failed, several have been cooled faster than considered desirable. Biological cells are ruptured
when foods are frozen, detracting from their taste. Repeated thawing and freezing accentuate the damage. Even the
oceans can be affected. A significant portion of the rise in sea level that is resulting from global warming is due to
the thermal expansion of sea water.

Metal is regularly used in the human body for hip and knee implants. Most implants need to be replaced over time
because, among other things, metal does not bond with bone. Researchers are trying to find better metal coatings
that would allow metal-to-bone bonding. One challenge is to find a coating that has an expansion coefficient similar
to that of metal. If the expansion coefficients are too different, the thermal stresses during the manufacturing
process lead to cracks at the coating-metal interface.

Another example of thermal stress is found in the mouth. Dental fillings can expand differently from tooth enamel. It
can give pain when eating ice cream or having a hot drink. Cracks might occur in the filling. Metal fillings (gold, silver,
etc.) are being replaced by composite fillings (porcelain), which have smaller coefficients of expansion, and are
closer to those of teeth.

      13.3 The Ideal Gas Law
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • State the ideal gas law in terms of molecules and in terms of moles.
       • Use the ideal gas law to calculate pressure change, temperature change, volume change, or the number
          of molecules or moles in a given volume.
       • Use Avogadro’s number to convert between number of molecules and number of moles.

      In this section, we continue to explore the thermal behavior of gases. In particular, we examine the characteristics
      of atoms and molecules that compose gases. (Most gases, for example nitrogen,          , and oxygen,  , are composed
      of two or more atoms. We will primarily use the term “molecule” in discussing a gas because the term can also be
      applied to monatomic gases, such as helium.)

      Gases are easily compressed. We can see evidence of this in Table 13.2, where you will note that gases have the
      largest coefficients of volume expansion. The large coefficients mean that gases expand and contract very rapidly
      with temperature changes. In addition, you will note that most gases expand at the same rate, or have the same .
      This raises the question as to why gases should all act in nearly the same way, when liquids and solids have widely
      varying expansion rates.

      The answer lies in the large separation of atoms and molecules in gases, compared to their sizes, as illustrated in
      Figure 13.17. Because atoms and molecules have large separations, forces between them can be ignored, except
      when they collide with each other during collisions. The motion of atoms and molecules (at temperatures well above
      the boiling temperature) is fast, such that the gas occupies all of the accessible volume and the expansion of gases
      is rapid. In contrast, in liquids and solids, atoms and molecules are closer together and are quite sensitive to the

forces between them.




FIGURE 13.17 Atoms and molecules in a gas are typically widely separated, as shown. Because the forces between them are quite weak at
these distances, the properties of a gas depend more on the number of atoms per unit volume and on temperature than on the type of
atom.

To get some idea of how pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas are related to one another, consider what
happens when you pump air into an initially deflated tire. The tire’s volume first increases in direct proportion to the
amount of air injected, without much increase in the tire pressure. Once the tire has expanded to nearly its full size,
the walls limit volume expansion. If we continue to pump air into it, the pressure increases. The pressure will further
increase when the car is driven and the tires move. Most manufacturers specify optimal tire pressure for cold tires.
(See Figure 13.18.)




FIGURE 13.18 (a) When air is pumped into a deflated tire, its volume first increases without much increase in pressure. (b) When the tire is
filled to a certain point, the tire walls resist further expansion and the pressure increases with more air. (c) Once the tire is inflated, its
pressure increases with temperature.

At room temperatures, collisions between atoms and molecules can be ignored. In this case, the gas is called an
ideal gas, in which case the relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature is given by the equation of
state called the ideal gas law.


  Ideal Gas Law
  The ideal gas law states that
                                                                                                                                    13.18
  where is the absolute pressure of a gas, is the volume it occupies,     is the number of atoms and molecules
  in the gas, and is its absolute temperature. The constant is called the Boltzmann constant in honor of
  Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) and has the value

                                                                                                                                    13.19


The ideal gas law can be derived from basic principles, but was originally deduced from experimental
measurements of Charles’ law (that volume occupied by a gas is proportional to temperature at a fixed pressure)
and from Boyle’s law (that for a fixed temperature, the product      is a constant). In the ideal gas model, the volume
occupied by its atoms and molecules is a negligible fraction of . The ideal gas law describes the behavior of real
gases under most conditions. (Note, for example, that     is the total number of atoms and molecules, independent
of the type of gas.)

Let us see how the ideal gas law is consistent with the behavior of filling the tire when it is pumped slowly and the
temperature is constant. At first, the pressure is essentially equal to atmospheric pressure, and the volume
increases in direct proportion to the number of atoms and molecules         put into the tire. Once the volume of the tire
is constant, the equation              predicts that the pressure should increase in proportion to the number N of

      atoms and molecules.


              EXAMPLE 13.6

      Calculating Pressure Changes Due to Temperature Changes: Tire Pressure
      Suppose your bicycle tire is fully inflated, with an absolute pressure of                 (a gauge pressure of just
      under           ) at a temperature of            . What is the pressure after its temperature has risen to       ?
      Assume that there are no appreciable leaks or changes in volume.

      Strategy

      The pressure in the tire is changing only because of changes in temperature. First we need to identify what we know
      and what we want to know, and then identify an equation to solve for the unknown.

      We know the initial pressure                      , the initial temperature           , and the final temperature
                   . We must find the final pressure . How can we use the equation              ? At first, it may seem
      that not enough information is given, because the volume and number of atoms         are not specified. What we can
      do is use the equation twice:                 and                  . If we divide by       we can come up with an
      equation that allows us to solve for .

                                                                                                                       13.20

      Since the volume is constant,   and        are the same and they cancel out. The same is true for      and     , and ,
      which is a constant. Therefore,

                                                                                                                       13.21

      We can then rearrange this to solve for      :

                                                                                                                       13.22

      where the temperature must be in units of kelvins, because       and     are absolute temperatures.

      2. Substitute the known values into the equation.

                                                                                                                       13.24

      Discussion

      The final temperature is about 6% greater than the original temperature, so the final pressure is about 6% greater
      as well. Note that absolute pressure and absolute temperature must be used in the ideal gas law.

Discussion

This number is undeniably large, considering that a gas is mostly empty space.     is huge, even in small volumes.
For example,         of a gas at STP has             molecules in it. Once again, note that    is the same for all
types or mixtures of gases.


Moles and Avogadro’s Number
It is sometimes convenient to work with a unit other than molecules when measuring the amount of substance. A
mole (abbreviated mol) is defined to be the amount of a substance that contains as many atoms or molecules as
there are atoms in exactly 12 grams (0.012 kg) of carbon-12. The actual number of atoms or molecules in one mole
is called Avogadro’s number       , in recognition of Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856). He developed
the concept of the mole, based on the hypothesis that equal volumes of gas, at the same pressure and temperature,
contain equal numbers of molecules. That is, the number is independent of the type of gas. This hypothesis has
been confirmed, and the value of Avogadro’s number is

                                                                                                                13.28


 Avogadro’s Number
 One mole always contains              particles (atoms or molecules), independent of the element or
 substance. A mole of any substance has a mass in grams equal to its molecular mass, which can be calculated
548   13 • Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws



        from the atomic masses given in the periodic table of elements.

      Solution
      We first need to calculate the molar mass (the mass of one mole) of acetaminophen. To do this, we need to multiply
      the number of atoms of each element by the element’s atomic mass.

                                                                                                                                     13.30

      (a) We are asked to find the number of moles per cubic meter, and we know from Example 13.7 that the number of
      molecules per cubic meter at STP is             . The number of moles can be found by dividing the number of
      molecules by Avogadro’s number. We let stand for the number of moles,

Discussion

This value is very close to the accepted value of 22.4 L/mol. The slight difference is due to rounding errors caused
by using three-digit input. Again this number is the same for all gases. In other words, it is independent of the gas.

            if the temperature and number of molecules are kept constant?
Solution
The best way to approach this question is to think about what is happening. If the density drops to half its original
value and no molecules are lost, then the volume must double. If we look at the equation              , we see that
when the temperature is constant, the pressure is inversely proportional to volume. Therefore, if the volume
doubles, the pressure must drop to half its original value, and


The Ideal Gas Law Restated Using Moles

molecules, . We start from the ideal gas law,

and multiply and divide the equation by Avogadro’s number         . This gives

Note that             is the number of moles. We define the universal gas constant                 , and obtain the ideal
gas law in terms of moles.

      Strategy

      Identify the knowns and unknowns, and choose an equation to solve for the unknown. In this case, we solve the
      ideal gas law,          , for the number of moles .

      Solution

      1. Identify the knowns.



                                                                                                                       13.40



      2. Rearrange the equation to solve for     and substitute known values.


                                                                                                                       13.41


      Discussion

      The most convenient choice for in this case is                  because our known quantities are in SI units. The
      pressure and temperature are obtained from the initial conditions in Example 13.6, but we would get the same
      answer if we used the final values.


      The ideal gas law can be considered to be another manifestation of the law of conservation of energy (see
      Conservation of Energy). Work done on a gas results in an increase in its energy, increasing pressure and/or
      temperature, or decreasing volume. This increased energy can also be viewed as increased internal kinetic energy,
      given the gas’s atoms and molecules.

      The Ideal Gas Law and Energy
      Let us now examine the role of energy in the behavior of gases. When you inflate a bike tire by hand, you do work by
      repeatedly exerting a force through a distance. This energy goes into increasing the pressure of air inside the tire
      and increasing the temperature of the pump and the air.

      The ideal gas law is closely related to energy: the units on both sides are joules. The right-hand side of the ideal gas
      law in             is      . This term is roughly the amount of translational kinetic energy of   atoms or molecules
      at an absolute temperature , as we shall see formally in Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular Explanation of
      Pressure and Temperature. The left-hand side of the ideal gas law is      , which also has the units of joules. We know
      from our study of fluids that pressure is one type of potential energy per unit volume, so pressure multiplied by
      volume is energy. The important point is that there is energy in a gas related to both its pressure and its volume. The
      energy can be changed when the gas is doing work as it expands—something we explore in Heat and Heat Transfer
      Methods—similar to what occurs in gasoline or steam engines and turbines.


        Problem-Solving Strategy: The Ideal Gas Law
        Step 1 Examine the situation to determine that an ideal gas is involved. Most gases are nearly ideal.

        Step 2 Make a list of what quantities are given, or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the
        known quantities). Convert known values into proper SI units (K for temperature, Pa for pressure,       for
        volume, molecules for , and moles for ).

        Step 3 Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknown quantities). A written
        list is useful.

 Step 4 Determine whether the number of molecules or the number of moles is known, in order to decide which
 form of the ideal gas law to use. The first form is         and involves , the number of atoms or molecules.
 The second form is              and involves , the number of moles.

 Step 5 Solve the ideal gas law for the quantity to be determined (the unknown quantity). You may need to take a
 ratio of final states to initial states to eliminate the unknown quantities that are kept fixed.

 Step 6 Substitute the known quantities, along with their units, into the appropriate equation, and obtain
 numerical solutions complete with units. Be certain to use absolute temperature and absolute pressure.

 Step 7 Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense?


    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Liquids and solids have densities about 1000 times greater than gases. Explain how this implies that the distances
between atoms and molecules in gases are about 10 times greater than the size of their atoms and molecules.
Solution
Atoms and molecules are close together in solids and liquids. In gases they are separated by empty space. Thus
gases have lower densities than liquids and solids. Density is mass per unit volume, and volume is related to the size
of a body (such as a sphere) cubed. So if the distance between atoms and molecules increases by a factor of 10,
then the volume occupied increases by a factor of 1000, and the density decreases by a factor of 1000.


13.4 Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular Explanation of Pressure and
Temperature
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Express the ideal gas law in terms of molecular mass and velocity.
 • Define thermal energy.
 • Calculate the kinetic energy of a gas molecule, given its temperature.
 • Describe the relationship between the temperature of a gas and the kinetic energy of atoms and
    molecules.
 • Describe the distribution of speeds of molecules in a gas.

We have developed macroscopic definitions of pressure and temperature. Pressure is the force divided by the area
on which the force is exerted, and temperature is measured with a thermometer. We gain a better understanding of
pressure and temperature from the kinetic theory of gases, which assumes that atoms and molecules are in
continuous random motion.
552   13 • Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws




      FIGURE 13.20 When a molecule collides with a rigid wall, the component of its momentum perpendicular to the wall is reversed. A force is
      thus exerted on the wall, creating pressure.

      Figure 13.20 shows an elastic collision of a gas molecule with the wall of a container, so that it exerts a force on the
      wall (by Newton’s third law). Because a huge number of molecules will collide with the wall in a short time, we
      observe an average force per unit area. These collisions are the source of pressure in a gas. As the number of
      molecules increases, the number of collisions and thus the pressure increase. Similarly, the gas pressure is higher if
      the average velocity of molecules is higher. The actual relationship is derived in the Things Great and Small feature
      below. The following relationship is found:

                                                                                                                                      13.42

      where is the pressure (average force per unit area), is the volume of gas in the container,   is the number of
      molecules in the container, is the mass of a molecule, and   is the average of the molecular speed squared.

      What can we learn from this atomic and molecular version of the ideal gas law? We can derive a relationship
      between temperature and the average translational kinetic energy of molecules in a gas. Recall the previous
      expression of the ideal gas law:
                                                                                                                                      13.43
      Equating the right-hand side of this equation with the right-hand side of                              gives

                                                                                                                                      13.44


        Making Connections: Things Great and Small—Atomic and Molecular Origin of
        Pressure in a Gas
        Figure 13.21 shows a box filled with a gas. We know from our previous discussions that putting more gas into
        the box produces greater pressure, and that increasing the temperature of the gas also produces a greater
        pressure. But why should increasing the temperature of the gas increase the pressure in the box? A look at the
        atomic and molecular scale gives us some answers, and an alternative expression for the ideal gas law.

        The figure shows an expanded view of an elastic collision of a gas molecule with the wall of a container.
        Calculating the average force exerted by such molecules will lead us to the ideal gas law, and to the connection
        between temperature and molecular kinetic energy. We assume that a molecule is small compared with the

separation of molecules in the gas, and that its interaction with other molecules can be ignored. We also assume
the wall is rigid and that the molecule’s direction changes, but that its speed remains constant (and hence its
kinetic energy and the magnitude of its momentum remain constant as well). This assumption is not always
valid, but the same result is obtained with a more detailed description of the molecule’s exchange of energy and
momentum with the wall.




FIGURE 13.21 Gas in a box exerts an outward pressure on its walls. A molecule colliding with a rigid wall has the direction of its
velocity and momentum in the -direction reversed. This direction is perpendicular to the wall. The components of its velocity
momentum in the - and -directions are not changed, which means there is no force parallel to the wall.

If the molecule’s velocity changes in the -direction, its momentum changes from           to        . Thus, its
change in momentum is                                     . The force exerted on the molecule is given by

                                                                                                                                13.45

There is no force between the wall and the molecule until the molecule hits the wall. During the short time of the
collision, the force between the molecule and wall is relatively large. We are looking for an average force; we
take     to be the average time between collisions of the molecule with this wall. It is the time it would take the
molecule to go across the box and back (a distance      at a speed of . Thus                 , and the expression
for the force becomes

                                                                                                                                13.46

This force is due to one molecule. We multiply by the number of molecules                      and use their average squared
velocity to find the force

                                                                                                                                13.47

where the bar over a quantity means its average value. We would like to have the force in terms of the speed ,
rather than the -component of the velocity. We note that the total velocity squared is the sum of the squares of
its components, so that

                                                                                                                                13.48

Because the velocities are random, their average components in all directions are the same:

        Thus,

                                                                                                                     13.50

        Substituting        into the expression for    gives

        The pressure is         so that we obtain

        where we used              for the volume. This gives the important result.

                                                                                                                     13.54

        This equation is another expression of the ideal gas law.


      We can get the average kinetic energy of a molecule,           , from the right-hand side of the equation by canceling
         and multiplying by 3/2. This calculation produces the result that the average kinetic energy of a molecule is
      directly related to absolute temperature.

                                                                                                                       13.55

      The average translational kinetic energy of a molecule,    , is called thermal energy. The equation
                            is a molecular interpretation of temperature, and it has been found to be valid for gases and
      reasonably accurate in liquids and solids. It is another definition of temperature based on an expression of the
      molecular energy.

      It is sometimes useful to rearrange                         , and solve for the average speed of molecules in a gas in

Before substituting values into this equation, we must convert the given temperature to kelvins. This conversion

The temperature alone is sufficient to find the average translational kinetic energy. Substituting the temperature

but we must first find the mass of a nitrogen molecule. Using the molecular mass of nitrogen                       from the periodic
table,

                                                                                                                                  13.60

Discussion

Note that the average kinetic energy of the molecule is independent of the type of molecule. The average
translational kinetic energy depends only on absolute temperature. The kinetic energy is very small compared to
macroscopic energies, so that we do not feel when an air molecule is hitting our skin. The rms velocity of the
nitrogen molecule is surprisingly large. These large molecular velocities do not yield macroscopic movement of air,
since the molecules move in all directions with equal likelihood. The mean free path (the distance a molecule can
move on average between collisions) of molecules in air is very small, and so the molecules move rapidly but do not
get very far in a second. The high value for rms speed is reflected in the speed of sound, however, which is about
340 m/s at room temperature. The faster the rms speed of air molecules, the faster that sound vibrations can be
transferred through the air. The speed of sound increases with temperature and is greater in gases with small
molecular masses, such as helium. (See Figure 13.22.)




FIGURE 13.22 (a) There are many molecules moving so fast in an ordinary gas that they collide a billion times every second. (b) Individual
molecules do not move very far in a small amount of time, but disturbances like sound waves are transmitted at speeds related to the
molecular speeds.
556   13 • Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws




        Making Connections: Historical Note—Kinetic Theory of Gases
        The kinetic theory of gases was developed by Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782), who is best known in physics for
        his work on fluid flow (hydrodynamics). Bernoulli’s work predates the atomistic view of matter established by
        Dalton.


      Distribution of Molecular Speeds
      The motion of molecules in a gas is random in magnitude and direction for individual molecules, but a gas of many
      molecules has a predictable distribution of molecular speeds. This distribution is called the Maxwell-Boltzmann
      distribution, after its originators, who calculated it based on kinetic theory, and has since been confirmed
      experimentally. (See Figure 13.23.) The distribution has a long tail, because a few molecules may go several times
      the rms speed. The most probable speed          is less than the rms speed       . Figure 13.24 shows that the curve is
      shifted to higher speeds at higher temperatures, with a broader range of speeds.




      FIGURE 13.23 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular speeds in an ideal gas. The most likely speed         is less than the rms
      speed      . Although very high speeds are possible, only a tiny fraction of the molecules have speeds that are an order of magnitude
      greater than      .

      The distribution of thermal speeds depends strongly on temperature. As temperature increases, the speeds are
      shifted to higher values and the distribution is broadened.




               FIGURE 13.24 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is shifted to higher speeds and is broadened at higher temperatures.

      What is the implication of the change in distribution with temperature shown in Figure 13.24 for humans? All other
      things being equal, if a person has a fever, they are likely to lose more water molecules, particularly from linings

         EXAMPLE 13.11

Calculating Temperature: Escape Velocity of Helium Atoms
In order to escape Earth’s gravity, an object near the top of the atmosphere (at an altitude of 100 km) must travel
away from Earth at 11.1 km/s. This speed is called the escape velocity. At what temperature would helium atoms

Identify the knowns and unknowns and determine which equations to use to solve the problem.

Solution

1. Identify the knowns:   is the escape velocity, 11.1 km/s.

atom.

Discussion

This temperature is much higher than atmospheric temperature, which is approximately 250 K                 or        at
high altitude. Very few helium atoms are left in the atmosphere, but there were many when the atmosphere was
formed. The reason for the loss of helium atoms is that there are a small number of helium atoms with speeds
higher than Earth’s escape velocity even at normal temperatures. The speed of a helium atom changes from one
instant to the next, so that at any instant, there is a small, but nonzero chance that the speed is greater than the
escape speed and the molecule escapes from Earth’s gravitational pull. Heavier molecules, such as oxygen,
nitrogen, and water (very little of which reach a very high altitude), have smaller rms speeds, and so it is much less
likely that any of them will have speeds greater than the escape velocity. In fact, so few have speeds above the
558   13 • Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws



      escape velocity that billions of years are required to lose significant amounts of the atmosphere. Figure 13.25 shows
      the impact of a lack of an atmosphere on the Moon. Because the gravitational pull of the Moon is much weaker, it
      has lost almost its entire atmosphere. The comparison between Earth and the Moon is discussed in this chapter’s
      Problems and Exercises.




      FIGURE 13.25 This photograph of Apollo 17 Commander Eugene Cernan driving the lunar rover on the Moon in 1972 looks as though it was
      taken at night with a large spotlight. In fact, the light is coming from the Sun. Because the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is so low
      (about 1/6 that of Earth), the Moon’s escape velocity is much smaller. As a result, gas molecules escape very easily from the Moon, leaving
      it with virtually no atmosphere. Even during the daytime, the sky is black because there is no gas to scatter sunlight. (credit: Harrison H.

           CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
      If you consider a very small object such as a grain of pollen, in a gas, then the number of atoms and molecules
      striking its surface would also be relatively small. Would the grain of pollen experience any fluctuations in pressure
      due to statistical fluctuations in the number of gas atoms and molecules striking it in a given amount of time?
      Solution
      Yes. Such fluctuations actually occur for a body of any size in a gas, but since the numbers of atoms and molecules
      are immense for macroscopic bodies, the fluctuations are a tiny percentage of the number of collisions, and the
      averages spoken of in this section vary imperceptibly. Roughly speaking the fluctuations are proportional to the
      inverse square root of the number of collisions, so for small bodies they can become significant. This was actually
      observed in the 19th century for pollen grains in water, and is known as the Brownian effect.

13.5 Phase Changes
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Interpret a phase diagram.
 • State Dalton’s law.
 • Identify and describe the triple point of a gas from its phase diagram.
 • Describe the state of equilibrium between a liquid and a gas, a liquid and a solid, and a gas and a solid.

Up to now, we have considered the behavior of ideal gases. Real gases are like ideal gases at high temperatures. At
lower temperatures, however, the interactions between the molecules and their volumes cannot be ignored. The
molecules are very close (condensation occurs) and there is a dramatic decrease in volume, as seen in Figure 13.26.
The substance changes from a gas to a liquid. When a liquid is cooled to even lower temperatures, it becomes a
solid. The volume never reaches zero because of the finite volume of the molecules.




FIGURE 13.26 A sketch of volume versus temperature for a real gas at constant pressure. The linear (straight line) part of the graph
represents ideal gas behavior—volume and temperature are directly and positively related and the line extrapolates to zero volume at
            , or absolute zero. When the gas becomes a liquid, however, the volume actually decreases precipitously at the liquefaction
point. The volume decreases slightly once the substance is solid, but it never becomes zero.

High pressure may also cause a gas to change phase to a liquid. Carbon dioxide, for example, is a gas at room
temperature and atmospheric pressure, but becomes a liquid under sufficiently high pressure. If the pressure is
reduced, the temperature drops and the liquid carbon dioxide solidifies into a snow-like substance at the
temperature         . Solid      is called “dry ice.” Another example of a gas that can be in a liquid phase is liquid
nitrogen       .       is made by liquefaction of atmospheric air (through compression and cooling). It boils at 77 K
          at atmospheric pressure.          is useful as a refrigerant and allows for the preservation of blood, sperm,
and other biological materials. It is also used to reduce noise in electronic sensors and equipment, and to help cool
down their current-carrying wires. In dermatology,           is used to freeze and painlessly remove warts and other
growths from the skin.

PV Diagrams
We can examine aspects of the behavior of a substance by plotting a graph of pressure versus volume, called a PV
diagram. When the substance behaves like an ideal gas, the ideal gas law describes the relationship between its
pressure and volume. That is,

                                                                                                                                   13.68

Now, assuming the number of molecules and the temperature are fixed,

                                                                                                                                   13.69

For example, the volume of the gas will decrease as the pressure increases. If you plot the relationship
               on a   diagram, you find a hyperbola. Figure 13.27 shows a graph of pressure versus volume. The
560   13 • Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws



      hyperbolas represent ideal-gas behavior at various fixed temperatures, and are called isotherms. At lower
      temperatures, the curves begin to look less like hyperbolas—the gas is not behaving ideally and may even contain
      liquid. There is a critical point—that is, a critical temperature—above which liquid cannot exist. At sufficiently high
      pressure above the critical point, the gas will have the density of a liquid but will not condense. Carbon dioxide, for
      example, cannot be liquefied at a temperature above              . Critical pressure is the minimum pressure needed for
      liquid to exist at the critical temperature. Table 13.3 lists representative critical temperatures and pressures.

      curves are at higher temperatures. The lower curves are not hyperbolas, because the gas is no longer an ideal gas. (b) An expanded portion
      of the      diagram for low temperatures, where the phase can change from a gas to a liquid. The term “vapor” refers to the gas phase when
      it exists at a temperature below the boiling temperature.

phase diagrams. Figure 13.28 shows the phase diagram for water. Using the graph, if you know the pressure and
temperature you can determine the phase of water. The solid lines—boundaries between phases—indicate
temperatures and pressures at which the phases coexist (that is, they exist together in ratios, depending on
pressure and temperature). For example, the boiling point of water is            at 1.00 atm. As the pressure increases,
the boiling temperature rises steadily to         at a pressure of 218 atm. A pressure cooker (or even a covered pot)
will cook food faster because the water can exist as a liquid at temperatures greater than           without all boiling
away. The curve ends at a point called the critical point, because at higher temperatures the liquid phase does not
exist at any pressure. The critical point occurs at the critical temperature, as you can see for water from Table 13.3.
The critical temperature for oxygen is          , so oxygen cannot be liquefied above this temperature.




FIGURE 13.28 The phase diagram (       graph) for water. Note that the axes are nonlinear and the graph is not to scale. This graph is
simplified—there are several other exotic phases of ice at higher pressures.

Similarly, the curve between the solid and liquid regions in Figure 13.28 gives the melting temperature at various
pressures. For example, the melting point is      at 1.00 atm, as expected. Note that, at a fixed temperature, you can
change the phase from solid (ice) to liquid (water) by increasing the pressure. Ice melts from pressure in the hands
of a snowball maker. From the phase diagram, we can also say that the melting temperature of ice falls with
increased pressure. When a car is driven over snow, the increased pressure from the tires melts the snowflakes;
afterwards the water refreezes and forms an ice layer.

At sufficiently low pressures there is no liquid phase, but the substance can exist as either gas or solid. For water,
there is no liquid phase at pressures below 0.00600 atm. The phase change from solid to gas is called sublimation.
It accounts for large losses of snow pack that never make it into a river, the routine automatic defrosting of a freezer,
and the freeze-drying process applied to many foods. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, sublimates at standard
atmospheric pressure of 1 atm. (The solid form of         is known as dry ice because it does not melt. Instead, it
moves directly from the solid to the gas state.)

All three curves on the phase diagram meet at a single point, the triple point, where all three phases exist in
equilibrium. For water, the triple point occurs at 273.16 K         , and is a more accurate calibration temperature
than the melting point of water at 1.00 atm, or 273.15 K         . See Table 13.4 for the triple point values of other
substances.

Equilibrium
Liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium at the boiling temperature. (See Figure 13.29.) If a substance is in a closed
container at the boiling point, then the liquid is boiling and the gas is condensing at the same rate without net
change in their relative amount. Molecules in the liquid escape as a gas at the same rate at which gas molecules
stick to the liquid, or form droplets and become part of the liquid phase. The combination of temperature and
pressure has to be “just right”; if the temperature and pressure are increased, equilibrium is maintained by the
same increase of boiling and condensation rates.

      FIGURE 13.29 Equilibrium between liquid and gas at two different boiling points inside a closed container. (a) The rates of boiling and
      condensation are equal at this combination of temperature and pressure, so the liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium. (b) At a higher
      temperature, the boiling rate is faster and the rates at which molecules leave the liquid and enter the gas are also faster. Because there are
      more molecules in the gas, the gas pressure is higher and the rate at which gas molecules condense and enter the liquid is faster. As a
      result the gas and liquid are in equilibrium at this higher temperature.

      One example of equilibrium between liquid and gas is that of water and steam at             and 1.00 atm. This
      temperature is the boiling point at that pressure, so they should exist in equilibrium. Why does an open pot of water
      at        boil completely away? The gas surrounding an open pot is not pure water: it is mixed with air. If pure water
      and steam are in a closed container at          and 1.00 atm, they would coexist—but with air over the pot, there are
      fewer water molecules to condense, and water boils. What about water at               and 1.00 atm? This temperature
      and pressure correspond to the liquid region, yet an open glass of water at this temperature will completely
      evaporate. Again, the gas around it is air and not pure water vapor, so that the reduced evaporation rate is greater
      than the condensation rate of water from dry air. If the glass is sealed, then the liquid phase remains. We call the gas
      phase a vapor when it exists, as it does for water at        , at a temperature below the boiling temperature.

Vapor Pressure, Partial Pressure, and Dalton’s Law
Vapor pressure is defined as the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or liquid phase. Vapor pressure is
created by faster molecules that break away from the liquid or solid and enter the gas phase. The vapor pressure of
a substance depends on both the substance and its temperature—an increase in temperature increases the vapor
pressure.

Partial pressure is defined as the pressure a gas would create if it occupied the total volume available. In a mixture
of gases, the total pressure is the sum of partial pressures of the component gases, assuming ideal gas behavior and
no chemical reactions between the components. This law is known as Dalton’s law of partial pressures, after the
English scientist John Dalton (1766–1844), who proposed it. Dalton’s law is based on kinetic theory, where each gas
creates its pressure by molecular collisions, independent of other gases present. It is consistent with the fact that
pressures add according to Pascal’s Principle. Thus water evaporates and ice sublimates when their vapor pressures
exceed the partial pressure of water vapor in the surrounding mixture of gases. If their vapor pressures are less than
the partial pressure of water vapor in the surrounding gas, liquid droplets or ice crystals (frost) form.

    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Is energy transfer involved in a phase change? If so, will energy have to be supplied to change phase from solid to
liquid and liquid to gas? What about gas to liquid and liquid to solid? Why do they spray the orange trees with water
in Florida when the temperatures are near or just below freezing?
Solution
Yes, energy transfer is involved in a phase change. We know that atoms and molecules in solids and liquids are
bound to each other because we know that force is required to separate them. So in a phase change from solid to
liquid and liquid to gas, a force must be exerted, perhaps by collision, to separate atoms and molecules. Force
exerted through a distance is work, and energy is needed to do work to go from solid to liquid and liquid to gas. This
is intuitively consistent with the need for energy to melt ice or boil water. The converse is also true. Going from gas
to liquid or liquid to solid involves atoms and molecules pushing together, doing work and releasing energy.

13.6 Humidity, Evaporation, and Boiling
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Explain the relationship between vapor pressure of water and the capacity of air to hold water vapor.
 • Explain the relationship between relative humidity and partial pressure of water vapor in the air.
 • Calculate vapor density using vapor pressure.
 • Calculate humidity and dew point.
564   13 • Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws




      FIGURE 13.30 Dew drops like these, on a banana leaf photographed just after sunrise, form when the air temperature drops to or below the
      dew point. At the dew point, the rate at which water molecules join together is greater than the rate at which they separate, and some of
      the water condenses to form droplets. (credit: Aaron Escobar, Flickr)

      The expression “it’s not the heat, it’s the humidity” makes a valid point. We keep cool in hot weather by evaporating
      sweat from our skin and water from our breathing passages. Because evaporation is inhibited by high humidity, we
      feel hotter at a given temperature when the humidity is high. Low humidity, on the other hand, can cause discomfort
      from excessive drying of mucous membranes and can lead to an increased risk of respiratory infections.

      When we say humidity, we really mean relative humidity. Relative humidity tells us how much water vapor is in the
      air compared with the maximum possible. At its maximum, denoted as saturation, the relative humidity is 100%,
      and evaporation is inhibited. The amount of water vapor in the air depends on temperature. For example, relative
      humidity rises in the evening, as air temperature declines, sometimes reaching the dew point. At the dew point
      temperature, relative humidity is 100%, and fog may result from the condensation of water droplets if they are small
      enough to stay in suspension. Conversely, if you wish to dry something (perhaps your hair), it is more effective to
      blow hot air over it rather than cold air, because, among other things, the increase in temperature increases the
      energy of the molecules, so the rate of evaporation increases.

      The amount of water vapor in the air depends on the vapor pressure of water. The liquid and solid phases are
      continuously giving off vapor because some of the molecules have high enough speeds to enter the gas phase; see
      Figure 13.31(a). If a lid is placed over the container, as in Figure 13.31(b), evaporation continues, increasing the
      pressure, until sufficient vapor has built up for condensation to balance evaporation. Then equilibrium has been
      achieved, and the vapor pressure is equal to the partial pressure of water in the container. Vapor pressure increases
      with temperature because molecular speeds are higher as temperature increases. Table 13.5 gives representative
      values of water vapor pressure over a range of temperatures.




      FIGURE 13.31 (a) Because of the distribution of speeds and kinetic energies, some water molecules can break away to the vapor phase
      even at temperatures below the ordinary boiling point. (b) If the container is sealed, evaporation will continue until there is enough vapor
      density for the condensation rate to equal the evaporation rate. This vapor density and the partial pressure it creates are the saturation
      values. They increase with temperature and are independent of the presence of other gases, such as air. They depend only on the vapor
      pressure of water.

      Relative humidity is related to the partial pressure of water vapor in the air. At 100% humidity, the partial pressure is

equal to the vapor pressure, and no more water can enter the vapor phase. If the partial pressure is less than the
vapor pressure, then evaporation will take place, as humidity is less than 100%. If the partial pressure is greater
than the vapor pressure, condensation takes place. In everyday language, people sometimes refer to the capacity of
air to “hold” water vapor, but this is not actually what happens. The water vapor is not held by the air. The amount of
water in air is determined by the vapor pressure of water and has nothing to do with the properties of air.

              EXAMPLE 13.12

      Calculating Density Using Vapor Pressure
      Table 13.5 gives the vapor pressure of water at        as                 Use the ideal gas law to calculate the
      density of water vapor in      that would create a partial pressure equal to this vapor pressure. Compare the result
      with the saturation vapor density given in the table.

      Strategy

      To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a two steps. The partial pressure follows the ideal gas law,
                                                                                                                        13.70
      where is the number of moles. If we solve this equation for      to calculate the number of moles per cubic meter,
      we can then convert this quantity to grams per cubic meter as requested. To do this, we need to use the molecular
      mass of water, which is given in the periodic table.

      Solution

      1. Identify the knowns and convert them to the proper units:

      a. temperature
      b. vapor pressure of water at             is
      c. molecular mass of water is

      2. Solve the ideal gas law for     .

      4. Convert the density in moles per cubic meter to grams per cubic meter.

      Discussion

      The density is obtained by assuming a pressure equal to the vapor pressure of water at             . The density found is
      identical to the value in Table 13.5, which means that a vapor density of              at         creates a partial
      pressure of                  equal to the vapor pressure of water at that temperature. If the partial pressure is equal
      to the vapor pressure, then the liquid and vapor phases are in equilibrium, and the relative humidity is 100%. Thus,
      there can be no more than 17.2 g of water vapor per       at        , so that this value is the saturation vapor density
      at that temperature. This example illustrates how water vapor behaves like an ideal gas: the pressure and density
      are consistent with the ideal gas law (assuming the density in the table is correct). The saturation vapor densities
      listed in Table 13.5 are the maximum amounts of water vapor that air can hold at various temperatures.

  Percent Relative Humidity
  We define percent relative humidity as the ratio of vapor density to saturation vapor density, or


                                                                                                                 13.74



We can use this and the data in Table 13.5 to do a variety of interesting calculations, keeping in mind that relative
humidity is based on the comparison of the partial pressure of water vapor in air and ice.


       EXAMPLE 13.13

Calculating Humidity and Dew Point
(a) Calculate the percent relative humidity on a day when the temperature is         and the air contains 9.40 g of
water vapor per     . (b) At what temperature will this air reach 100% relative humidity (the saturation density)? This
temperature is the dew point. (c) What is the humidity when the air temperature is          and the dew point is
         ?

Strategy and Solution

(a) Percent relative humidity is defined as the ratio of vapor density to saturation vapor density.

                                                                                                                   13.75

The first is given to be          , and the second is found in Table 13.5 to be             . Thus,


                                                                                                                   13.76


(b) The air contains            of water vapor. The relative humidity will be 100% at a temperature where
is the saturation density. Inspection of Table 13.5 reveals this to be the case at       , where the relative humidity
will be 100%. That temperature is called the dew point for air with this concentration of water vapor.

(c) Here, the dew point temperature is given to be            . Using Table 13.5, we see that the vapor density is
            , because this value is the saturation vapor density at          . The saturation vapor density at           is
seen to be             . Thus, the relative humidity at         is


                                                                                                                   13.77


Discussion

The importance of dew point is that air temperature cannot drop below            in part (b), or        in part (c),
without water vapor condensing out of the air. If condensation occurs, considerable transfer of heat occurs
(discussed in Heat and Heat Transfer Methods), which prevents the temperature from further dropping. When dew
points are below     , freezing temperatures are a greater possibility, which explains why farmers keep track of the
dew point. Low humidity in deserts means low dew-point temperatures. Thus condensation is unlikely. If the
temperature drops, vapor does not condense in liquid drops. Because no heat is released into the air, the air
temperature drops more rapidly compared to air with higher humidity. Likewise, at high temperatures, liquid
droplets do not evaporate, so that no heat is removed from the gas to the liquid phase. This explains the large range
of temperature in arid regions.


Why does water boil at      ? You will note from Table 13.5 that the vapor pressure of water at       is
            , or 1.00 atm. Thus, it can evaporate without limit at this temperature and pressure. But why does it
568   13 • Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws



      form bubbles when it boils? This is because water ordinarily contains significant amounts of dissolved air and other
      impurities, which are observed as small bubbles of air in a glass of water. If a bubble starts out at the bottom of the
      container at         , it contains water vapor (about 2.30%). The pressure inside the bubble is fixed at 1.00 atm (we
      ignore the slight pressure exerted by the water around it). As the temperature rises, the amount of air in the bubble
      stays the same, but the water vapor increases; the bubble expands to keep the pressure at 1.00 atm. At             ,
      water vapor enters the bubble continuously since the partial pressure of water is equal to 1.00 atm in equilibrium. It
      cannot reach this pressure, however, since the bubble also contains air and total pressure is 1.00 atm. The bubble
      grows in size and thereby increases the buoyant force. The bubble breaks away and rises rapidly to the surface—we
      call this boiling! (See Figure 13.32.)




      FIGURE 13.32 (a) An air bubble in water starts out saturated with water vapor at     . (b) As the temperature rises, water vapor enters the
      bubble because its vapor pressure increases. The bubble expands to keep its pressure at 1.00 atm. (c) At        , water vapor enters the
      bubble continuously because water’s vapor pressure exceeds its partial pressure in the bubble, which must be less than 1.00 atm. The
      bubble grows and rises to the surface.

           CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
      Freeze drying is a process in which substances, such as foods, are dried by placing them in a vacuum chamber and
      lowering the atmospheric pressure around them. How does the lowered atmospheric pressure speed the drying
      process, and why does it cause the temperature of the food to drop?
      Solution
      Decreased the atmospheric pressure results in decreased partial pressure of water, hence a lower humidity. So
      evaporation of water from food, for example, will be enhanced. The molecules of water most likely to break away
      from the food will be those with the greatest velocities. Those remaining thus have a lower average velocity and a
      lower temperature. This can (and does) result in the freezing and drying of the food; hence the process is aptly
      named freeze drying.

INTRODUCTION TO HEAT AND HEAT TRANSFER METHODS Energy can exist in many forms and heat is one of the
most intriguing. Heat is often hidden, as it only exists when in transit, and is transferred by a number of distinctly
different methods. Heat transfer touches every aspect of our lives and helps us understand how the universe
functions. It explains the chill we feel on a clear breezy night, or why Earth’s core has yet to cool. This chapter
defines and explores heat transfer, its effects, and the methods by which heat is transferred. These topics are
fundamental, as well as practical, and will often be referred to in the chapters ahead.

14.1 Heat
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define heat as transfer of energy.

In Work, Energy, and Energy Resources, we defined work as force times distance and learned that work done on an
object changes its kinetic energy. We also saw in Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws that temperature is
proportional to the (average) kinetic energy of atoms and molecules. We say that a thermal system has a certain
578   14 • Heat and Heat Transfer Methods



      internal energy: its internal energy is higher if the temperature is higher. If two objects at different temperatures are
      brought in contact with each other, energy is transferred from the hotter to the colder object until equilibrium is
      reached and the bodies reach thermal equilibrium (i.e., they are at the same temperature). No work is done by either
      object, because no force acts through a distance. The transfer of energy is caused by the temperature difference,
      and ceases once the temperatures are equal. These observations lead to the following definition of heat: Heat is the
      spontaneous transfer of energy due to a temperature difference.

      As noted in Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws, heat is often confused with temperature. For example,
      we may say the heat was unbearable, when we actually mean that the temperature was high. Heat is a form of
      energy, whereas temperature is not. The misconception arises because we are sensitive to the flow of heat, rather
      than the temperature.

      Owing to the fact that heat is a form of energy, it has the SI unit of joule (J). The calorie (cal) is a common unit of
      energy, defined as the energy needed to change the temperature of 1.00 g of water by                   —specifically,
      between           and         , since there is a slight temperature dependence. Perhaps the most common unit of
      heat is the kilocalorie (kcal), which is the energy needed to change the temperature of 1.00 kg of water by             .
      Since mass is most often specified in kilograms, kilocalorie is commonly used. Food calories (given the notation Cal,
      and sometimes called “big calorie”) are actually kilocalories (                                    ), a fact not easily
      determined from package labeling.




      FIGURE 14.2 In figure (a) the soft drink and the ice have different temperatures,       and , and are not in thermal equilibrium. In figure
      (b), when the soft drink and ice are allowed to interact, energy is transferred until they reach the same temperature , achieving
      equilibrium. Heat transfer occurs due to the difference in temperatures. In fact, since the soft drink and ice are both in contact with the
      surrounding air and bench, the equilibrium temperature will be the same for both.

      Mechanical Equivalent of Heat
      It is also possible to change the temperature of a substance by doing work. Work can transfer energy into or out of a
      system. This realization helped establish the fact that heat is a form of energy. James Prescott Joule (1818–1889)
      performed many experiments to establish the mechanical equivalent of heat—the work needed to produce the
      same effects as heat transfer. In terms of the units used for these two terms, the best modern value for this
      equivalence is
                                                                                                                                             14.1
      We consider this equation as the conversion between two different units of energy.

             FIGURE 14.3 Schematic depiction of Joule’s experiment that established the equivalence of heat and work.

The figure above shows one of Joule’s most famous experimental setups for demonstrating the mechanical
equivalent of heat. It demonstrated that work and heat can produce the same effects, and helped establish the
principle of conservation of energy. Gravitational potential energy (PE) (work done by the gravitational force) is
converted into kinetic energy (KE), and then randomized by viscosity and turbulence into increased average kinetic
energy of atoms and molecules in the system, producing a temperature increase. His contributions to the field of
thermodynamics were so significant that the SI unit of energy was named after him.

Heat added or removed from a system changes its internal energy and thus its temperature. Such a temperature
increase is observed while cooking. However, adding heat does not necessarily increase the temperature. An
example is melting of ice; that is, when a substance changes from one phase to another. Work done on the system or
by the system can also change the internal energy of the system. Joule demonstrated that the temperature of a
system can be increased by stirring. If an ice cube is rubbed against a rough surface, work is done by the frictional
force. A system has a well-defined internal energy, but we cannot say that it has a certain “heat content” or “work
content”. We use the phrase “heat transfer” to emphasize its nature.

    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Two samples (A and B) of the same substance are kept in a lab. Someone adds 10 kilojoules (kJ) of heat to one
sample, while 10 kJ of work is done on the other sample. How can you tell to which sample the heat was added?
Solution
Heat and work both change the internal energy of the substance. However, the properties of the sample only depend
on the internal energy so that it is impossible to tell whether heat was added to sample A or B.


14.2 Temperature Change and Heat Capacity
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Observe heat transfer and change in temperature and mass.
 • Calculate final temperature after heat transfer between two objects.

One of the major effects of heat transfer is temperature change: heating increases the temperature while cooling
decreases it. We assume that there is no phase change and that no work is done on or by the system. Experiments
show that the transferred heat depends on three factors—the change in temperature, the mass of the system, and
the substance and phase of the substance.
580   14 • Heat and Heat Transfer Methods




      FIGURE 14.4 The heat transferred to cause a temperature change depends on the magnitude of the temperature change, the mass of
      the system, and the substance and phase involved. (a) The amount of heat transferred is directly proportional to the temperature change.
      To double the temperature change of a mass , you need to add twice the heat. (b) The amount of heat transferred is also directly
      proportional to the mass. To cause an equivalent temperature change in a doubled mass, you need to add twice the heat. (c) The amount of
      heat transferred depends on the substance and its phase. If it takes an amount of heat to cause a temperature change         in a given
      mass of copper, it will take 10.8 times that amount of heat to cause the equivalent temperature change in the same mass of water
      assuming no phase change in either substance.

      The dependence on temperature change and mass are easily understood. Owing to the fact that the (average)
      kinetic energy of an atom or molecule is proportional to the absolute temperature, the internal energy of a system is
      proportional to the absolute temperature and the number of atoms or molecules. Owing to the fact that the
      transferred heat is equal to the change in the internal energy, the heat is proportional to the mass of the substance
      and the temperature change. The transferred heat also depends on the substance so that, for example, the heat
      necessary to raise the temperature is less for alcohol than for water. For the same substance, the transferred heat
      also depends on the phase (gas, liquid, or solid).


        Heat Transfer and Temperature Change
        The quantitative relationship between heat transfer and temperature change contains all three factors:
                                                                                                                                     14.2
        where is the symbol for heat transfer, is the mass of the substance, and             is the change in temperature.
        The symbol stands for specific heat and depends on the material and phase. The specific heat is the amount
        of heat necessary to change the temperature of 1.00 kg of mass by            . The specific heat is a property of
        the substance; its SI unit is           or             Recall that the temperature change         is the same in
        units of kelvin and degrees Celsius. If heat transfer is measured in kilocalories, then the unit of specific heat is




      Values of specific heat must generally be looked up in tables, because there is no simple way to calculate them. In
      general, the specific heat also depends on the temperature. Table 14.1 lists representative values of specific heat
      for various substances. Except for gases, the temperature and volume dependence of the specific heat of most
      substances is weak. We see from this table that the specific heat of water is five times that of glass and ten times
      that of iron, which means that it takes five times as much heat to raise the temperature of water the same amount
      as for glass and ten times as much heat to raise the temperature of water as for iron. In fact, water has one of the
      largest specific heats of any material, which is important for sustaining life on Earth.

       EXAMPLE 14.1

Calculating the Required Heat: Heating Water in an Aluminum Pan
A 0.500 kg aluminum pan on a stove is used to heat 0.250 liters of water from          to         . (a) How much heat
is required? What percentage of the heat is used to raise the temperature of (b) the pan and (c) the water?

Strategy

The pan and the water are always at the same temperature. When you put the pan on the stove, the temperature of
the water and the pan is increased by the same amount. We use the equation for the heat transfer for the given
temperature change and mass of water and aluminum. The specific heat values for water and aluminum are given in
Table 14.1.

Solution

Because water is in thermal contact with the aluminum, the pan and the water are at the same temperature.

1. Calculate the temperature difference:
                                                                                                                   14.3

2. Calculate the mass of water. Because the density of water is                , one liter of water has a mass of 1 kg,
   and the mass of 0.250 liters of water is                .
3. Calculate the heat transferred to the water. Use the specific heat of water in Table 14.1:
                                                                                                                 14.4

4. Calculate the heat transferred to the aluminum. Use the specific heat for aluminum in Table 14.1:
                                                                                                                   14.5

5. Compare the percentage of heat going into the pan versus that going into the water. First, find the total
   transferred heat:
                                                                                                                   14.6
Thus, the amount of heat going into heating the pan is

                                                                                                                   14.7

and the amount going into heating the water is

                                                                                                                   14.8

Discussion

In this example, the heat transferred to the container is a significant fraction of the total transferred heat. Although
the mass of the pan is twice that of the water, the specific heat of water is over four times greater than that of
aluminum. Therefore, it takes a bit more than twice the heat to achieve the given temperature change for the water
as compared to the aluminum pan.

              EXAMPLE 14.2

      Calculating the Temperature Increase from the Work Done on a Substance: Truck Brakes
      Overheat on Downhill Runs
      Truck brakes used to control speed on a downhill run do work, converting gravitational potential energy into
      increased internal energy (higher temperature) of the brake material. This conversion prevents the gravitational
      potential energy from being converted into kinetic energy of the truck. The problem is that the mass of the truck is
      large compared with that of the brake material absorbing the energy, and the temperature increase may occur too
      fast for sufficient heat to transfer from the brakes to the environment.

      Calculate the temperature increase of 100 kg of brake material with an average specific heat of             if the
      material retains 10% of the energy from a 10,000-kg truck descending 75.0 m (in vertical displacement) at a
      constant speed.

      Strategy

      If the brakes are not applied, gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. When brakes are
      applied, gravitational potential energy is converted into internal energy of the brake material. We first calculate the
      gravitational potential energy         that the entire truck loses in its descent and then find the temperature
      increase produced in the brake material alone.

      Solution

      1. Calculate the change in gravitational potential energy as the truck goes downhill
                                                                                                                                     14.9

                                                                                                                                    14.11


      Discussion

      This same idea underlies the recent hybrid technology of cars, where mechanical energy (gravitational potential
      energy) is converted by the brakes into electrical energy (battery).

              EXAMPLE 14.3

      Calculating the Final Temperature When Heat Is Transferred Between Two Bodies: Pouring
      Cold Water in a Hot Pan
      Suppose you pour 0.250 kg of            water (about a cup) into a 0.500-kg aluminum pan off the stove with a
      temperature of          . Assume that the pan is placed on an insulated pad and that a negligible amount of water
      boils off. What is the temperature when the water and pan reach thermal equilibrium a short time later?

      Strategy

      The pan is placed on an insulated pad so that little heat transfer occurs with the surroundings. Originally the pan and
      water are not in thermal equilibrium: the pan is at a higher temperature than the water. Heat transfer then restores
      thermal equilibrium once the water and pan are in contact. Because heat transfer between the pan and water takes
      place rapidly, the mass of evaporated water is negligible and the magnitude of the heat lost by the pan is equal to
      the heat gained by the water. The exchange of heat stops once a thermal equilibrium between the pan and the water
      is achieved. The heat exchange can be written as                   .

      Solution

      1. Use the equation for heat transfer            to express the heat lost by the aluminum pan in terms of the
         mass of the pan, the specific heat of aluminum, the initial temperature of the pan, and the final temperature:
                                                                                                                   14.12
      2. Express the heat gained by the water in terms of the mass of the water, the specific heat of water, the initial
         temperature of the water and the final temperature:
                                                                                                                     14.13
      3. Note that          and            and that they must sum to zero because the heat lost by the hot pan must be
         the same as the heat gained by the cold water:

Discussion

This is a typical calorimetry problem—two bodies at different temperatures are brought in contact with each other
and exchange heat until a common temperature is reached. Why is the final temperature so much closer to
than         ? The reason is that water has a greater specific heat than most common substances and thus undergoes
a small temperature change for a given heat transfer. A large body of water, such as a lake, requires a large amount
of heat to increase its temperature appreciably. This explains why the temperature of a lake stays relatively constant
during a day even when the temperature change of the air is large. However, the water temperature does change
over longer times (e.g., summer to winter).



 Take-Home Experiment: Temperature Change of Land and Water
 What heats faster, land or water?

 To study differences in heat capacity:

   • Place equal masses of dry sand (or soil) and water at the same temperature into two small jars. (The
     average density of soil or sand is about 1.6 times that of water, so you can achieve approximately equal
     masses by using        more water by volume.)
   • Heat both (using an oven or a heat lamp) for the same amount of time.
   • Record the final temperature of the two masses.
   • Now bring both jars to the same temperature by heating for a longer period of time.
   • Remove the jars from the heat source and measure their temperature every 5 minutes for about 30
     minutes.

 Which sample cools off the fastest? This activity replicates the phenomena responsible for land breezes and sea
 breezes.


    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
If 25 kJ is necessary to raise the temperature of a block from      to     , how much heat is necessary to heat the
block from        to      ?
Solution
The heat transfer depends only on the temperature difference. Since the temperature differences are the same in
both cases, the same 25 kJ is necessary in the second case.


14.3 Phase Change and Latent Heat
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Examine heat transfer.
 • Calculate final temperature from heat transfer.

So far we have discussed temperature change due to heat transfer. No temperature change occurs from heat
transfer if ice melts and becomes liquid water (i.e., during a phase change). For example, consider water dripping
from icicles melting on a roof warmed by the Sun. Conversely, water freezes in an ice tray cooled by lower-
temperature surroundings.

                             FIGURE 14.6 Heat from the air transfers to the ice causing it to melt. (credit: Mike Brand)

      Energy is required to melt a solid because the cohesive bonds between the molecules in the solid must be broken
      apart such that, in the liquid, the molecules can move around at comparable kinetic energies; thus, there is no rise in
      temperature. Similarly, energy is needed to vaporize a liquid, because molecules in a liquid interact with each other
      via attractive forces. There is no temperature change until a phase change is complete. The temperature of a cup of
      soda initially at     stays at     until all the ice has melted. Conversely, energy is released during freezing and
      condensation, usually in the form of thermal energy. Work is done by cohesive forces when molecules are brought
      together. The corresponding energy must be given off (dissipated) to allow them to stay together Figure 14.7.

      The energy involved in a phase change depends on two major factors: the number and strength of bonds or force
      pairs. The number of bonds is proportional to the number of molecules and thus to the mass of the sample. The
      strength of forces depends on the type of molecules. The heat required to change the phase of a sample of mass
         is given by

                                                                                                                               14.17
                                                                                                                               14.18

FIGURE 14.7 (a) Energy is required to partially overcome the attractive forces between molecules in a solid to form a liquid. That same
energy must be removed for freezing to take place. (b) Molecules are separated by large distances when going from liquid to vapor,
requiring significant energy to overcome molecular attraction. The same energy must be removed for condensation to take place. There is
no temperature change until a phase change is complete.

Latent heat is measured in units of J/kg. Both      and     depend on the substance, particularly on the strength of its
molecular forces as noted earlier.      and    are collectively called latent heat coefficients. They are latent, or
hidden, because in phase changes, energy enters or leaves a system without causing a temperature change in the
system; so, in effect, the energy is hidden. Table 14.2 lists representative values of    and     , together with
melting and boiling points.

The table shows that significant amounts of energy are involved in phase changes. Let us look, for example, at how
much energy is needed to melt a kilogram of ice at     to produce a kilogram of water at         . Using the equation for
a change in temperature and the value for water from Table 14.2, we find that
                                          is the energy to melt a kilogram of ice. This is a lot of energy as it
represents the same amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of liquid water from            to       .
Even more energy is required to vaporize water; it would take 2256 kJ to change 1 kg of liquid water at the normal
boiling point (     at atmospheric pressure) to steam (water vapor). This example shows that the energy for a
phase change is enormous compared to energy associated with temperature changes without a phase change.

                TABLE 14.2 Heats of Fusion and Vaporization

      Phase changes can have a tremendous stabilizing effect even on temperatures that are not near the melting and
      boiling points, because evaporation and condensation (conversion of a gas into a liquid state) occur even at
      temperatures below the boiling point. Take, for example, the fact that air temperatures in humid climates rarely go
      above         , which is because most heat transfer goes into evaporating water into the air. Similarly, temperatures
      in humid weather rarely fall below the dew point because enormous heat is released when water vapor condenses.

      We examine the effects of phase change more precisely by considering adding heat into a sample of ice at
      (Figure 14.8). The temperature of the ice rises linearly, absorbing heat at a constant rate of                until it
      reaches     . Once at this temperature, the ice begins to melt until all the ice has melted, absorbing 79.8 cal/g of
      heat. The temperature remains constant at         during this phase change. Once all the ice has melted, the
      temperature of the liquid water rises, absorbing heat at a new constant rate of                 . At      , the water
      begins to boil and the temperature again remains constant while the water absorbs 539 cal/g of heat during this
      phase change. When all the liquid has become steam vapor, the temperature rises again, absorbing heat at a rate of
                       .

FIGURE 14.8 A graph of temperature versus energy added. The system is constructed so that no vapor evaporates while ice warms to
become liquid water, and so that, when vaporization occurs, the vapor remains in of the system. The long stretches of constant temperature
values at    and        reflect the large latent heat of melting and vaporization, respectively.

Water can evaporate at temperatures below the boiling point. More energy is required than at the boiling point,
because the kinetic energy of water molecules at temperatures below            is less than that at    , hence less
energy is available from random thermal motions. Take, for example, the fact that, at body temperature, perspiration
from the skin requires a heat input of 2428 kJ/kg, which is about 10 percent higher than the latent heat of
vaporization at        . This heat comes from the skin, and thus provides an effective cooling mechanism in hot
weather. High humidity inhibits evaporation, so that body temperature might rise, leaving unevaporated sweat on
your brow.


        EXAMPLE 14.4

Calculate Final Temperature from Phase Change: Cooling Soda with Ice Cubes
Three ice cubes are used to chill a soda at      with mass                  . The ice is at    and each ice cube has
a mass of 6.0 g. Assume that the soda is kept in a foam container so that heat loss can be ignored. Assume the soda
has the same heat capacity as water. Find the final temperature when all ice has melted.

Strategy

The ice cubes are at the melting temperature of      . Heat is transferred from the soda to the ice for melting. Melting
of ice occurs in two steps: first the phase change occurs and solid (ice) transforms into liquid water at the melting
temperature, then the temperature of this water rises. Melting yields water at      , so more heat is transferred from
the soda to this water until the water plus soda system reaches thermal equilibrium,
                                                                                                                                 14.19
The heat transferred to the ice is                                                 . The heat given off by the soda is
                                . Since no heat is lost,                         , so that
                                                                                                                                 14.20

      Discussion

      This example illustrates the enormous energies involved during a phase change. The mass of ice is about 7 percent
      the mass of water but leads to a noticeable change in the temperature of soda. Although we assumed that the ice
      was at the freezing temperature, this is incorrect: the typical temperature is      . However, this correction gives a
      final temperature that is essentially identical to the result we found. Can you explain why?


      We have seen that vaporization requires heat transfer to a liquid from the surroundings, so that energy is released
      by the surroundings. Condensation is the reverse process, increasing the temperature of the surroundings. This
      increase may seem surprising, since we associate condensation with cold objects—the glass in the figure, for
      example. However, energy must be removed from the condensing molecules to make a vapor condense. The energy
      is exactly the same as that required to make the phase change in the other direction, from liquid to vapor, and so it
      can be calculated from             .




      FIGURE 14.9 Condensation forms on this glass of iced tea because the temperature of the nearby air is reduced to below the dew point.
      The rate at which water molecules join together exceeds the rate at which they separate, and so water condenses. Energy is released when
      the water condenses, speeding the melting of the ice in the glass. (credit: Jenny Downing)


        Real-World Application
        Energy is also released when a liquid freezes. This phenomenon is used by fruit growers in Florida to protect
        oranges when the temperature is close to the freezing point       . Growers spray water on the plants in
        orchards so that the water freezes and heat is released to the growing oranges on the trees. This prevents the
        temperature inside the orange from dropping below freezing, which would damage the fruit.

Sublimation is the transition from solid to vapor phase. You may have noticed that snow can disappear into thin air
without a trace of liquid water, or the disappearance of ice cubes in a freezer. The reverse is also true: Frost can form
on very cold windows without going through the liquid stage. A popular effect is the making of “smoke” from dry ice,
which is solid carbon dioxide. Sublimation occurs because the equilibrium vapor pressure of solids is not zero.
Certain air fresheners use the sublimation of a solid to inject a perfume into the room. Moth balls are a slightly toxic
example of a phenol (an organic compound) that sublimates, while some solids, such as osmium tetroxide, are so
toxic that they must be kept in sealed containers to prevent human exposure to their sublimation-produced vapors.




FIGURE 14.11 Direct transitions between solid and vapor are common, sometimes useful, and even beautiful. (a) Dry ice sublimates
directly to carbon dioxide gas. The visible vapor is made of water droplets. (credit: Windell Oskay) (b) Frost forms patterns on a very cold
window, an example of a solid formed directly from a vapor. (credit: Liz West)

All phase transitions involve heat. In the case of direct solid-vapor transitions, the energy required is given by the
equation              , where     is the heat of sublimation, which is the energy required to change 1.00 kg of a
substance from the solid phase to the vapor phase.        is analogous to     and     , and its value depends on the
substance. Sublimation requires energy input, so that dry ice is an effective coolant, whereas the reverse process
(i.e., frosting) releases energy. The amount of energy required for sublimation is of the same order of magnitude as
592   14 • Heat and Heat Transfer Methods



      that for other phase transitions.

      The material presented in this section and the preceding section allows us to calculate any number of effects
      related to temperature and phase change. In each case, it is necessary to identify which temperature and phase
      changes are taking place and then to apply the appropriate equation. Keep in mind that heat transfer and work can
      cause both temperature and phase changes.

      Problem-Solving Strategies for the Effects of Heat Transfer
      1. Examine the situation to determine that there is a change in the temperature or phase. Is there heat transfer
         into or out of the system? When the presence or absence of a phase change is not obvious, you may wish to first
         solve the problem as if there were no phase changes, and examine the temperature change obtained. If it is
         sufficient to take you past a boiling or melting point, you should then go back and do the problem in
         steps—temperature change, phase change, subsequent temperature change, and so on.
      2. Identify and list all objects that change temperature and phase.
      3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful.
      4. Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).
      5. Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown). If there is a temperature
         change, the transferred heat depends on the specific heat (see Table 14.1) whereas, for a phase change, the
         transferred heat depends on the latent heat. See Table 14.2.
      6. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions
         complete with units. You will need to do this in steps if there is more than one stage to the process (such as a
         temperature change followed by a phase change).
      7. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? As an example, be certain that the temperature
         change does not also cause a phase change that you have not taken into account.

           CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
      Why does snow remain on mountain slopes even when daytime temperatures are higher than the freezing
      temperature?
      Solution
      Snow is formed from ice crystals and thus is the solid phase of water. Because enormous heat is necessary for
      phase changes, it takes a certain amount of time for this heat to be accumulated from the air, even if the air is above
         . The warmer the air is, the faster this heat exchange occurs and the faster the snow melts.


      14.4 Heat Transfer Methods
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Discuss the different methods of heat transfer.

      Equally as interesting as the effects of heat transfer on a system are the methods by which this occurs. Whenever
      there is a temperature difference, heat transfer occurs. Heat transfer may occur rapidly, such as through a cooking
      pan, or slowly, such as through the walls of a picnic ice chest. We can control rates of heat transfer by choosing
      materials (such as thick wool clothing for the winter), controlling air movement (such as the use of weather stripping
      around doors), or by choice of color (such as a white roof to reflect summer sunlight). So many processes involve
      heat transfer, so that it is hard to imagine a situation where no heat transfer occurs. Yet every process involving heat
      transfer takes place by only three methods:

      1. Conduction is heat transfer through stationary matter by physical contact. (The matter is stationary on a
         macroscopic scale—we know there is thermal motion of the atoms and molecules at any temperature above
         absolute zero.) Heat transferred between the electric burner of a stove and the bottom of a pan is transferred by
         conduction.
      2. Convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a fluid. This type of transfer takes place in a
         forced-air furnace and in weather systems, for example.
      3. Heat transfer by radiation occurs when microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, or another form of

     less obvious example is thermal radiation from the human body.




FIGURE 14.12 In a fireplace, heat transfer occurs by all three methods: conduction, convection, and radiation. Radiation is responsible for
most of the heat transferred into the room. Heat transfer also occurs through conduction into the room, but at a much slower rate. Heat
transfer by convection also occurs through cold air entering the room around windows and hot air leaving the room by rising up the
chimney.

We examine these methods in some detail in the three following modules. Each method has unique and interesting
characteristics, but all three do have one thing in common: they transfer heat solely because of a temperature
difference Figure 14.12.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Name an example from daily life (different from the text) for each mechanism of heat transfer.
Solution
Conduction: Heat transfers into your hands as you hold a hot cup of coffee.

Convection: Heat transfers as the barista “steams” cold milk to make hot cocoa.

Radiation: Reheating a cold cup of coffee in a microwave oven.

      inside (in summers). (credit: Giles Douglas)

      Your feet feel cold as you walk barefoot across the living room carpet in your cold house and then step onto the
      kitchen tile floor. This result is intriguing, since the carpet and tile floor are both at the same temperature. The
      different sensation you feel is explained by the different rates of heat transfer: the heat loss during the same time
      interval is greater for skin in contact with the tiles than with the carpet, so the temperature drop is greater on the
      tiles.

      Some materials conduct thermal energy faster than others. In general, good conductors of electricity (metals like
      copper, aluminum, gold, and silver) are also good heat conductors, whereas insulators of electricity (wood, plastic,
      and rubber) are poor heat conductors. Figure 14.14 shows molecules in two bodies at different temperatures. The
      (average) kinetic energy of a molecule in the hot body is higher than in the colder body. If two molecules collide, an
      energy transfer from the molecule with greater kinetic energy to the molecule with less kinetic energy occurs. The
      cumulative effect from all collisions results in a net flux of heat from the hot body to the colder body. The heat flux
      thus depends on the temperature difference                            . Therefore, you will get a more severe burn from
      boiling water than from hot tap water. Conversely, if the temperatures are the same, the net heat transfer rate falls
      to zero, and equilibrium is achieved. Owing to the fact that the number of collisions increases with increasing area,
      heat conduction depends on the cross-sectional area. If you touch a cold wall with your palm, your hand cools faster
      than if you just touch it with your fingertip.




      FIGURE 14.14 The molecules in two bodies at different temperatures have different average kinetic energies. Collisions occurring at the
      contact surface tend to transfer energy from high-temperature regions to low-temperature regions. In this illustration, a molecule in the
      lower temperature region (right side) has low energy before collision, but its energy increases after colliding with the contact surface. In
      contrast, a molecule in the higher temperature region (left side) has high energy before collision, but its energy decreases after colliding

with the contact surface.

A third factor in the mechanism of conduction is the thickness of the material through which heat transfers. The
figure below shows a slab of material with different temperatures on either side. Suppose that           is greater than ,
so that heat is transferred from left to right. Heat transfer from the left side to the right side is accomplished by a
series of molecular collisions. The thicker the material, the more time it takes to transfer the same amount of heat.
This model explains why thick clothing is warmer than thin clothing in winters, and why Arctic mammals protect
themselves with thick blubber.




FIGURE 14.15 Heat conduction occurs through any material, represented here by a rectangular bar, whether window glass or walrus
blubber. The temperature of the material is       on the left and on the right, where is greater than . The rate of heat transfer by
conduction is directly proportional to the surface area , the temperature difference        , and the substance’s conductivity . The rate
of heat transfer is inversely proportional to the thickness .

Lastly, the heat transfer rate depends on the material properties described by the coefficient of thermal
conductivity. All four factors are included in a simple equation that was deduced from and is confirmed by
experiments. The rate of conductive heat transfer through a slab of material, such as the one in Figure 14.15, is
given by

        EXAMPLE 14.5

Calculating Heat Transfer Through Conduction: Conduction Rate Through an Ice Box
A Styrofoam ice box has a total area of               and walls with an average thickness of 2.50 cm. The box contains
ice, water, and canned beverages at        . The inside of the box is kept cold by melting ice. How much ice melts in
one day if the ice box is kept in the trunk of a car at        ?

Strategy

This question involves both heat for a phase change (melting of ice) and the transfer of heat by conduction. To find
the amount of ice melted, we must find the net heat transferred. This value can be obtained by calculating the rate
of heat transfer by conduction and multiplying by time.

Solution

1. Identify the knowns.

      Discussion

      The result of 3.44 kg, or about 7.6 lbs, seems about right, based on experience. You might expect to use about a 4
      kg (7–10 lb) bag of ice per day. A little extra ice is required if you add any warm food or beverages.

      Inspecting the conductivities in Table 14.3 shows that Styrofoam is a very poor conductor and thus a good insulator.
      Other good insulators include fiberglass, wool, and goose-down feathers. Like Styrofoam, these all incorporate
      many small pockets of air, taking advantage of air’s poor thermal conductivity.

ratio     is called the factor. The rate of conductive heat transfer is inversely proportional to . The larger the
value of , the better the insulation. factors are most commonly quoted for household insulation, refrigerators,
and the like—unfortunately, it is still in non-metric units of ft2·°F·h/Btu, although the unit usually goes unstated (1
British thermal unit [Btu] is the amount of energy needed to change the temperature of 1.0 lb of water by 1.0 °F). A
couple of representative values are an factor of 11 for 3.5-in-thick fiberglass batts (pieces) of insulation and an
factor of 19 for 6.5-in-thick fiberglass batts. Walls are usually insulated with 3.5-in batts, while ceilings are usually
insulated with 6.5-in batts. In cold climates, thicker batts may be used in ceilings and walls.

      Calculating the Temperature Difference Maintained by a Heat Transfer: Conduction Through
      an Aluminum Pan
      Water is boiling in an aluminum pan placed on an electrical element on a stovetop. The sauce pan has a bottom that
      is 0.800 cm thick and 14.0 cm in diameter. The boiling water is evaporating at the rate of 1.00 g/s. What is the
      temperature difference across (through) the bottom of the pan?

      Strategy

      Conduction through the aluminum is the primary method of heat transfer here, and so we use the equation for the
      rate of heat transfer and solve for the temperature difference.

                                                                                                                     14.32

      Discussion

      The value for the heat transfer                              is typical for an electric stove. This value gives a
      remarkably small temperature difference between the stove and the pan. Consider that the stove burner is red hot
      while the inside of the pan is nearly       because of its contact with boiling water. This contact effectively cools
      the bottom of the pan in spite of its proximity to the very hot stove burner. Aluminum is such a good conductor that it
      only takes this small temperature difference to produce a heat transfer of 2.26 kW into the pan.

      Conduction is caused by the random motion of atoms and molecules. As such, it is an ineffective mechanism for
      heat transport over macroscopic distances and short time distances. Take, for example, the temperature on the
      Earth, which would be unbearably cold during the night and extremely hot during the day if heat transport in the
      atmosphere was to be only through conduction. In another example, car engines would overheat unless there was a
      more efficient way to remove excess heat from the pistons.


           CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
      How does the rate of heat transfer by conduction change when all spatial dimensions are doubled?
      Solution
      Because area is the product of two spatial dimensions, it increases by a factor of four when each dimension is
      doubled                                     . The distance, however, simply doubles. Because the temperature
      difference and the coefficient of thermal conductivity are independent of the spatial dimensions, the rate of heat
      transfer by conduction increases by a factor of four divided by two, or two:

14.6 Convection
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Discuss the method of heat transfer by convection.

Convection is driven by large-scale flow of matter. In the case of Earth, the atmospheric circulation is caused by the
flow of hot air from the tropics to the poles, and the flow of cold air from the poles toward the tropics. (Note that
Earth’s rotation causes the observed easterly flow of air in the northern hemisphere). Car engines are kept cool by
the flow of water in the cooling system, with the water pump maintaining a flow of cool water to the pistons. The
circulatory system is used the body: when the body overheats, the blood vessels in the skin expand (dilate), which
increases the blood flow to the skin where it can be cooled by sweating. These vessels become smaller when it is
cold outside and larger when it is hot (so more fluid flows, and more energy is transferred).

The body also loses a significant fraction of its heat through the breathing process.

While convection is usually more complicated than conduction, we can describe convection and do some
straightforward, realistic calculations of its effects. Natural convection is driven by buoyant forces: hot air rises
because density decreases as temperature increases. The house in Figure 14.17 is kept warm in this manner, as is
the pot of water on the stove in Figure 14.18. Ocean currents and large-scale atmospheric circulation transfer
energy from one part of the globe to another. Both are examples of natural convection.




FIGURE 14.17 Air heated by the so-called gravity furnace expands and rises, forming a convective loop that transfers energy to other parts
of the room. As the air is cooled at the ceiling and outside walls, it contracts, eventually becoming denser than room air and sinking to the
floor. A properly designed heating system using natural convection, like this one, can be quite efficient in uniformly heating a home.




FIGURE 14.18 Convection plays an important role in heat transfer inside this pot of water. Once conducted to the inside, heat transfer to
other parts of the pot is mostly by convection. The hotter water expands, decreases in density, and rises to transfer heat to other regions of
the water, while colder water sinks to the bottom. This process keeps repeating.

      Most houses are not airtight: air goes in and out around doors and windows, through cracks and crevices, following
      wiring to switches and outlets, and so on. The air in a typical house is completely replaced in less than an hour.
      Suppose that a moderately-sized house has inside dimensions                                high, and that all air is
      replaced in 30.0 min. Calculate the heat transfer per unit time in watts needed to warm the incoming cold air by
              , thus replacing the heat transferred by convection alone.

      Strategy

      Heat is used to raise the temperature of air so that            . The rate of heat transfer is then    , where is the
      time for air turnover. We are given that    is       , but we must still find values for the mass of air and its specific
      heat before we can calculate . The specific heat of air is a weighted average of the specific heats of nitrogen and
      oxygen, which gives                           from Table 14.1 (note that the specific heat at constant pressure must
      be used for this process).

      Solution

      1. Determine the mass of air from its density and the given volume of the house. The density is given from the
         density and the volume
                                                                                                                        14.37

      2. Calculate the heat transferred from the change in air temperature:                  so that
                                                                                                                        14.38

      3. Calculate the heat transfer from the heat and the turnover time . Since air is turned over in
                               , the heat transferred per unit time is

                                                                                                                        14.39

      Discussion

      This rate of heat transfer is equal to the power consumed by about forty-six 100-W light bulbs. Newly constructed
      homes are designed for a turnover time of 2 hours or more, rather than 30 minutes for the house of this example.
      Weather stripping, caulking, and improved window seals are commonly employed. More extreme measures are
      sometimes taken in very cold (or hot) climates to achieve a tight standard of more than 6 hours for one air turnover.
      Still longer turnover times are unhealthy, because a minimum amount of fresh air is necessary to supply oxygen for
      breathing and to dilute household pollutants. The term used for the process by which outside air leaks into the
      house from cracks around windows, doors, and the foundation is called “air infiltration.”


      A cold wind is much more chilling than still cold air, because convection combines with conduction in the body to
      increase the rate at which energy is transferred away from the body. The table below gives approximate wind-chill
      factors, which are the temperatures of still air that produce the same rate of cooling as air of a given temperature
      and speed. Wind-chill factors are a dramatic reminder of convection’s ability to transfer heat faster than conduction.
      For example, a 15.0 m/s wind at       has the chilling equivalent of still air at about      .

Although air can transfer heat rapidly by convection, it is a poor conductor and thus a good insulator. The amount of
available space for airflow determines whether air acts as an insulator or conductor. The space between the inside
and outside walls of a house, for example, is about 9 cm (3.5 in) —large enough for convection to work effectively.
The addition of wall insulation prevents airflow, so heat loss (or gain) is decreased. Similarly, the gap between the
two panes of a double-paned window is about 1 cm, which prevents convection and takes advantage of air’s low
conductivity to prevent greater loss. Fur, fiber, and fiberglass also take advantage of the low conductivity of air by
trapping it in spaces too small to support convection, as shown in the figure. Fur and feathers are lightweight and
thus ideal for the protection of animals.




FIGURE 14.19 Fur is filled with air, breaking it up into many small pockets. Convection is very slow here, because the loops are so small.
The low conductivity of air makes fur a very good lightweight insulator.

Some interesting phenomena happen when convection is accompanied by a phase change. It allows us to cool off
by sweating, even if the temperature of the surrounding air exceeds body temperature. Heat from the skin is
required for sweat to evaporate from the skin, but without air flow, the air becomes saturated and evaporation
stops. Air flow caused by convection replaces the saturated air by dry air and evaporation continues.
602   14 • Heat and Heat Transfer Methods




              EXAMPLE 14.8

      Calculate the Flow of Mass during Convection: Sweat-Heat Transfer away from the Body
      The average person produces heat at the rate of about 120 W when at rest. At what rate must water evaporate from
      the body to get rid of all this energy? (This evaporation might occur when a person is sitting in the shade and
      surrounding temperatures are the same as skin temperature, eliminating heat transfer by other methods.)

      Strategy

      Energy is needed for a phase change (            ). Thus, the energy loss per unit time is

                                                                                                                    14.40

      We divide both sides of the equation by      to find that the mass evaporated per unit time is

                                                                                                                    14.41

      Solution

      (1) Insert the value of the latent heat from Table 14.2,                               . This yields

                                                                                                                    14.42

      Discussion

      Evaporating about 3 g/min seems reasonable. This would be about 180 g (about 7 oz) per hour. If the air is very dry,
      the sweat may evaporate without even being noticed. A significant amount of evaporation also takes place in the
      lungs and breathing passages.


      Another important example of the combination of phase change and convection occurs when water evaporates from
      the oceans. Heat is removed from the ocean when water evaporates. If the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets
      as clouds form, heat is released in the atmosphere. Thus, there is an overall transfer of heat from the ocean to the
      atmosphere. This process is the driving power behind thunderheads, those great cumulus clouds that rise as much
      as 20.0 km into the stratosphere. Water vapor carried in by convection condenses, releasing tremendous amounts
      of energy. This energy causes the air to expand and rise, where it is colder. More condensation occurs in these colder
      regions, which in turn drives the cloud even higher. Such a mechanism is called positive feedback, since the process
      reinforces and accelerates itself. These systems sometimes produce violent storms, with lightning and hail, and
      constitute the mechanism driving hurricanes.

The movement of icebergs is another example of convection accompanied by a phase change. Suppose an iceberg
drifts from Greenland into warmer Atlantic waters. Heat is removed from the warm ocean water when the ice melts
and heat is released to the land mass when the iceberg forms on Greenland.

604   14 • Heat and Heat Transfer Methods



      Solution
      Using a fan increases the flow of air: warm air near your body is replaced by cooler air from elsewhere. Convection
      increases the rate of heat transfer so that moving air “feels” cooler than still air.


      14.7 Radiation
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Discuss heat transfer by radiation.
       • Explain the power of different materials.

      You can feel the heat transfer from a fire and from the Sun. Similarly, you can sometimes tell that the oven is hot
      without touching its door or looking inside—it may just warm you as you walk by. The space between the Earth and
      the Sun is largely empty, without any possibility of heat transfer by convection or conduction. In these examples,
      heat is transferred by radiation. That is, the hot body emits electromagnetic waves that are absorbed by our skin: no
      medium is required for electromagnetic waves to propagate. Different names are used for electromagnetic waves of
      different wavelengths: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and
      gamma rays.




      FIGURE 14.23 Most of the heat transfer from this fire to the observers is through infrared radiation. The visible light, although dramatic,
      transfers relatively little thermal energy. Convection transfers energy away from the observers as hot air rises, while conduction is negligibly
      slow here. Skin is very sensitive to infrared radiation, so that you can sense the presence of a fire without looking at it directly. (credit:
      Daniel X. O’Neil)

      The energy of electromagnetic radiation depends on the wavelength (color) and varies over a wide range: a smaller
      wavelength (or higher frequency) corresponds to a higher energy. Because more heat is radiated at higher
      temperatures, a temperature change is accompanied by a color change. Take, for example, an electrical element on
      a stove, which glows from red to orange, while the higher-temperature steel in a blast furnace glows from yellow to
      white. The radiation you feel is mostly infrared, which corresponds to a lower temperature than that of the electrical
      element and the steel. The radiated energy depends on its intensity, which is represented in the figure below by the
      height of the distribution.

      Electromagnetic Waves explains more about the electromagnetic spectrum and Introduction to Quantum Physics
      discusses how the decrease in wavelength corresponds to an increase in energy.

FIGURE 14.24 (a) A graph of the spectra of electromagnetic waves emitted from an ideal radiator at three different temperatures. The
intensity or rate of radiation emission increases dramatically with temperature, and the spectrum shifts toward the visible and ultraviolet
parts of the spectrum. The shaded portion denotes the visible part of the spectrum. It is apparent that the shift toward the ultraviolet with
temperature makes the visible appearance shift from red to white to blue as temperature increases. (b) Note the variations in color

All objects absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation. The rate of heat transfer by radiation is largely determined by
the color of the object. Black is the most effective, and white is the least effective. People living in hot climates
generally avoid wearing black clothing, for instance. Similarly, black asphalt in a parking lot will be hotter than
adjacent gray sidewalk on a summer day, because black absorbs better than gray. The reverse is also true—black
radiates better than gray. Thus, on a clear summer night, the asphalt will be colder than the gray sidewalk, because
black radiates the energy more rapidly than gray. An ideal radiator is the same color as an ideal absorber, and
captures all the radiation that falls on it. In contrast, white is a poor absorber and is also a poor radiator. A white
object reflects all radiation, like a mirror. (A perfect, polished white surface is mirror-like in appearance, and a
crushed mirror looks white.)




FIGURE 14.25 This illustration shows that the darker pavement is hotter than the lighter pavement (much more of the ice on the right has
melted), although both have been in the sunlight for the same time. The thermal conductivities of the pavements are the same.

Gray objects have a uniform ability to absorb all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Colored objects behave in
similar but more complex ways, which gives them a particular color in the visible range and may make them special
in other ranges of the nonvisible spectrum. Take, for example, the strong absorption of infrared radiation by the skin,
which allows us to be very sensitive to it.
606   14 • Heat and Heat Transfer Methods




      FIGURE 14.26 A black object is a good absorber and a good radiator, while a white (or silver) object is a poor absorber and a poor radiator.
      It is as if radiation from the inside is reflected back into the silver object, whereas radiation from the inside of the black object is “absorbed”
      when it hits the surface and finds itself on the outside and is strongly emitted.

      The rate of heat transfer by emitted radiation is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law of radiation:

                                                                                                                                               14.43

      where                                     is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, is the surface area of the object, and is
      its absolute temperature in kelvin. The symbol stands for the emissivity of the object, which is a measure of how
      well it radiates. An ideal jet-black (or black body) radiator has     , whereas a perfect reflector has     . Real
      objects fall between these two values. Take, for example, tungsten light bulb filaments which have an of about      ,
      and carbon black (a material used in printer toner), which has the (greatest known) emissivity of about       .

      The radiation rate is directly proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature—a remarkably strong
      temperature dependence. Furthermore, the radiated heat is proportional to the surface area of the object. If you
      knock apart the coals of a fire, there is a noticeable increase in radiation due to an increase in radiating surface area.

spectrum. Thus, we are all nearly (jet) black in the infrared, in spite of the obvious variations in skin color. This high
infrared emissivity is why we can so easily feel radiation on our skin. It is also the basis for the use of night scopes
used by law enforcement and the military to detect human beings. Even small temperature variations can be
detected because of the      dependence. Images, called thermographs, can be used medically to detect regions of
abnormally high temperature in the body, perhaps indicative of disease. Similar techniques can be used to detect
heat leaks in homes Figure 14.27, optimize performance of blast furnaces, improve comfort levels in work
environments, and even remotely map the Earth’s temperature profile.

All objects emit and absorb radiation. The net rate of heat transfer by radiation (absorption minus emission) is
related to both the temperature of the object and the temperature of its surroundings. Assuming that an object with
a temperature      is surrounded by an environment with uniform temperature , the net rate of heat transfer by
radiation is

                                                                                                                   14.44

where is the emissivity of the object alone. In other words, it does not matter whether the surroundings are white,
gray, or black; the balance of radiation into and out of the object depends on how well it emits and absorbs
radiation. When           , the quantity        is positive; that is, the net heat transfer is from hot to cold.

                                                                                                                   14.47
Discussion

This value is a significant rate of heat transfer to the environment (note the minus sign), considering that a person at
rest may produce energy at the rate of 125 W and that conduction and convection will also be transferring energy to
the environment. Indeed, we would probably expect this person to feel cold. Clothing significantly reduces heat
transfer to the environment by many methods, because clothing slows down both conduction and convection, and
has a lower emissivity (especially if it is white) than skin.


The Earth receives almost all its energy from radiation of the Sun and reflects some of it back into outer space.
Because the Sun is hotter than the Earth, the net energy flux is from the Sun to the Earth. However, the rate of
608   14 • Heat and Heat Transfer Methods



      energy transfer is less than the equation for the radiative heat transfer would predict because the Sun does not fill
      the sky. The average emissivity ( ) of the Earth is about 0.65, but the calculation of this value is complicated by the
      fact that the highly reflective cloud coverage varies greatly from day to day. There is a negative feedback (one in
      which a change produces an effect that opposes that change) between clouds and heat transfer; greater
      temperatures evaporate more water to form more clouds, which reflect more radiation back into space, reducing the
      temperature. The often mentioned greenhouse effect is directly related to the variation of the Earth’s emissivity
      with radiation type (see the figure given below). The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon responsible for
      providing temperatures suitable for life on Earth. The Earth’s relatively constant temperature is a result of the
      energy balance between the incoming solar radiation and the energy radiated from the Earth. Most of the infrared
      radiation emitted from the Earth is absorbed by carbon dioxide (        ) and water (      ) in the atmosphere and then
      re-radiated back to the Earth or into outer space. Re-radiation back to the Earth maintains its surface temperature
      about        higher than it would be if there was no atmosphere, similar to the way glass increases temperatures in a
      greenhouse.

      The greenhouse effect and its causes were first predicted by Eunice Newton Foote after she designed and
      conducted experiments on heating of different gases. After filling flasks with carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and regular
      air, then also modifying moisture, she placed them in the sun and carefully measured their heating and, especially,
      their heat retention. She discovered that the CO2 flask gained the most temperature and held it the longest. After
      subsequent research, her paper "Circumstances affecting the Heat of the Sun’s Rays" included conclusions that an
      atmosphere consisting of more carbon dioxide would be hotter resulting from the gas trapping radiation.




      FIGURE 14.28 The greenhouse effect is a name given to the trapping of energy in the Earth’s atmosphere by a process similar to that used
      in greenhouses. The atmosphere, like window glass, is transparent to incoming visible radiation and most of the Sun’s infrared. These
      wavelengths are absorbed by the Earth and re-emitted as infrared. Since Earth’s temperature is much lower than that of the Sun, the
      infrared radiated by the Earth has a much longer wavelength. The atmosphere, like glass, traps these longer infrared rays, keeping the Earth
      warmer than it would otherwise be. The amount of trapping depends on concentrations of trace gases like carbon dioxide, and a change in
      the concentration of these gases is believed to affect the Earth’s surface temperature.

      The greenhouse effect is also central to the discussion of global warming due to emission of carbon dioxide and
      methane (and other so-called greenhouse gases) into the Earth’s atmosphere from industrial production and
      farming. Changes in global climate could lead to more intense storms, precipitation changes (affecting agriculture),
      reduction in rain forest biodiversity, and rising sea levels.

      Heating and cooling are often significant contributors to energy use in individual homes. Mária Telkes, a Hungarian-
      born American scientist, was among the foremost developers of solar energy applications in industrial and
      community use. After inventing a widely deployed solar seawater distiller used on World War II life rafts, she
      partnered with architect Eleanor Raymond to design the first modern home to be completely heated by solar power.
      Air warmed on rooftop collectors transferred heat to salts, which stored the heat for later use. Telkes later worked
      with the Department of Energy to develop the first solar-electrically powered home. Current research efforts into
      developing environmentally friendly homes quite often focus on reducing conventional heating and cooling through
      better building materials, strategically positioning windows to optimize radiation gain from the Sun, and opening
      spaces to allow convection. It is possible to build a zero-energy house that allows for comfortable living in most

Conversely, dark space is very cold, about                , so that the Earth radiates energy into the dark sky. Owing
to the fact that clouds have lower emissivity than either oceans or land masses, they reflect some of the radiation
back to the surface, greatly reducing heat transfer into dark space, just as they greatly reduce heat transfer into the
atmosphere during the day. The rate of heat transfer from soil and grasses can be so rapid that frost may occur on
clear summer evenings, even in warm latitudes.

The radiated heat is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. Because                                     and
            , the rate of heat transfer increases by about 30 percent of the original rate.



  Career Connection: Energy Conservation Consultation
  The cost of energy is generally believed to remain very high for the foreseeable future. Thus, passive control of
  heat loss in both commercial and domestic housing will become increasingly important. Energy consultants
  measure and analyze the flow of energy into and out of houses and ensure that a healthy exchange of air is
  maintained inside the house. The job prospects for an energy consultant are strong.



  Problem-Solving Strategies for the Methods of Heat Transfer
  1. Examine the situation to determine what type of heat transfer is involved.
  2. Identify the type(s) of heat transfer—conduction, convection, or radiation.
  3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is very
     useful.
  4. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).
  5. Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown).
  6. For conduction, equation                               is appropriate. Table 14.3 lists thermal conductivities. For
       convection, determine the amount of matter moved and use equation                   , to calculate the heat
       transfer involved in the temperature change of the fluid. If a phase change accompanies convection,
       equation             or          is appropriate to find the heat transfer involved in the phase change. Table
       14.2 lists information relevant to phase change. For radiation, equation                                               gives the

           net heat transfer rate.
        7. Insert the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions
           complete with units.
        8. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable. Does it make sense?

INTRODUCTION TO THERMODYNAMICS Heat transfer is energy in transit, and it can be used to do work. It can
also be converted to any other form of energy. A car engine, for example, burns fuel for heat transfer into a gas. Work
is done by the gas as it exerts a force through a distance, converting its energy into a variety of other forms—into the
car’s kinetic or gravitational potential energy; into electrical energy to run the spark plugs, radio, and lights; and
back into stored energy in the car’s battery. But most of the heat transfer produced from burning fuel in the engine
does not do work on the gas. Rather, the energy is released into the environment, implying that the engine is quite
inefficient.

It is often said that modern gasoline engines cannot be made to be significantly more efficient. We hear the same
about heat transfer to electrical energy in large power stations, whether they are coal, oil, natural gas, or nuclear
powered. Why is that the case? Is the inefficiency caused by design problems that could be solved with better
engineering and superior materials? Is it part of some money-making conspiracy by those who sell energy? Actually,
the truth is more interesting, and reveals much about the nature of heat transfer.

Basic physical laws govern how heat transfer for doing work takes place and place insurmountable limits onto its
efficiency. This chapter will explore these laws as well as many applications and concepts associated with them.
These topics are part of thermodynamics—the study of heat transfer and its relationship to doing work.

      15.1 The First Law of Thermodynamics
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define the first law of thermodynamics.
       • Describe how conservation of energy relates to the first law of thermodynamics.
       • Identify instances of the first law of thermodynamics working in everyday situations, including biological
          metabolism.
       • Calculate changes in the internal energy of a system, after accounting for heat transfer and work done.




      FIGURE 15.2 This boiling tea kettle represents energy in motion. The water in the kettle is turning to water vapor because heat is being
      transferred from the stove to the kettle. As the entire system gets hotter, work is done—from the evaporation of the water to the whistling of
      the kettle. (credit: Gina Hamilton)

      If we are interested in how heat transfer is converted into doing work, then the conservation of energy principle is
      important. The first law of thermodynamics applies the conservation of energy principle to systems where heat
      transfer and doing work are the methods of transferring energy into and out of the system. The first law of
      thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a system equals the net heat transfer into the system
      minus the net work done by the system. In equation form, the first law of thermodynamics is
                                                                                                                                            15.1
      Here       is the change in internal energy of the system. is the net heat transferred into the system—that is,
      is the sum of all heat transfer into and out of the system.       is the net work done by the system—that is,     is the
      sum of all work done on or by the system. We use the following sign conventions: if is positive, then there is a net
      heat transfer into the system; if     is positive, then there is net work done by the system. So positive adds energy
      to the system and positive       takes energy from the system. Thus                    . Note also that if more heat
      transfer into the system occurs than work done, the difference is stored as internal energy. Heat engines are a good
      example of this—heat transfer into them takes place so that they can do work. (See Figure 15.3.) We will now
      examine ,        , and     further.

  Making Connections: Law of Thermodynamics and Law of Conservation of Energy
  The first law of thermodynamics is actually the law of conservation of energy stated in a form most useful in
  thermodynamics. The first law gives the relationship between heat transfer, work done, and the change in
  internal energy of a system.


Heat Q and Work W
Heat transfer ( ) and doing work ( ) are the two everyday means of bringing energy into or taking energy out of a
system. The processes are quite different. Heat transfer, a less organized process, is driven by temperature
differences. Work, a quite organized process, involves a macroscopic force exerted through a distance.
Nevertheless, heat and work can produce identical results.For example, both can cause a temperature increase.
Heat transfer into a system, such as when the Sun warms the air in a bicycle tire, can increase its temperature, and
so can work done on the system, as when the bicyclist pumps air into the tire. Once the temperature increase has
occurred, it is impossible to tell whether it was caused by heat transfer or by doing work. This uncertainty is an
important point. Heat transfer and work are both energy in transit—neither is stored as such in a system. However,
both can change the internal energy of a system. Internal energy is a form of energy completely different from
either heat or work.

Internal Energy U
We can think about the internal energy of a system in two different but consistent ways. The first is the atomic and
molecular view, which examines the system on the atomic and molecular scale. The internal energy of a system
is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of its atoms and molecules. Recall that kinetic plus potential energy
is called mechanical energy. Thus internal energy is the sum of atomic and molecular mechanical energy. Because it
is impossible to keep track of all individual atoms and molecules, we must deal with averages and distributions. A
second way to view the internal energy of a system is in terms of its macroscopic characteristics, which are very
similar to atomic and molecular average values.

Macroscopically, we define the change in internal energy                  to be that given by the first law of thermodynamics:
                                                                                                                                      15.2
Many detailed experiments have verified that                 , where       is the change in total kinetic and potential
energy of all atoms and molecules in a system. It has also been determined experimentally that the internal energy
   of a system depends only on the state of the system and not how it reached that state. More specifically, is
found to be a function of a few macroscopic quantities (pressure, volume, and temperature, for example),
independent of past history such as whether there has been heat transfer or work done. This independence means
that if we know the state of a system, we can calculate changes in its internal energy from a few macroscopic
variables.
626   15 • Thermodynamics




        Making Connections: Macroscopic and Microscopic
        In thermodynamics, we often use the macroscopic picture when making calculations of how a system behaves,
        while the atomic and molecular picture gives underlying explanations in terms of averages and distributions. We
        shall see this again in later sections of this chapter. For example, in the topic of entropy, calculations will be
        made using the atomic and molecular view.


      To get a better idea of how to think about the internal energy of a system, let us examine a system going from State
      1 to State 2. The system has internal energy      in State 1, and it has internal energy   in State 2, no matter how it
      got to either state. So the change in internal energy                   is independent of what caused the change. In
      other words,       is independent of path. By path, we mean the method of getting from the starting point to the
      ending point. Why is this independence important? Note that                     . Both and      depend on path, but
           does not. This path independence means that internal energy is easier to consider than either heat transfer
      or work done.


              EXAMPLE 15.1

      Calculating Change in Internal Energy: The Same Change in                         is Produced by Two Different
      Processes
      (a) Suppose there is heat transfer of 40.00 J to a system, while the system does 10.00 J of work. Later, there is heat
      transfer of 25.00 J out of the system while 4.00 J of work is done on the system. What is the net change in internal
      energy of the system?

      (b) What is the change in internal energy of a system when a total of 150.00 J of heat transfer occurs out of (from)
      the system and 159.00 J of work is done on the system? (See Figure 15.4).

      Strategy

      In part (a), we must first find the net heat transfer and net work done from the given information. Then the first law
      of thermodynamics                       can be used to find the change in internal energy. In part (b), the net heat
      transfer and work done are given, so the equation can be used directly.

      Solution for (a)

      The net heat transfer is the heat transfer into the system minus the heat transfer out of the system, or
                                                                                                                        15.3
      Similarly, the total work is the work done by the system minus the work done on the system, or
                                                                                                                        15.4
      Thus the change in internal energy is given by the first law of thermodynamics:
                                                                                                                        15.5
      We can also find the change in internal energy for each of the two steps. First, consider 40.00 J of heat transfer in
      and 10.00 J of work out, or
                                                                                                                        15.6
      Now consider 25.00 J of heat transfer out and 4.00 J of work in, or
                                                                                                                        15.7
      The total change is the sum of these two steps, or
                                                                                                                        15.8

Discussion on (a)

No matter whether you look at the overall process or break it into steps, the change in internal energy is the same.

Solution for (b)

Here the net heat transfer and total work are given directly to be                                   and                       , so that
                                                                                                                                           15.9

Discussion on (b)

A very different process in part (b) produces the same 9.00-J change in internal energy as in part (a). Note that the
change in the system in both parts is related to      and not to the individual s or      s involved. The system ends
up in the same state in both (a) and (b). Parts (a) and (b) present two different paths for the system to follow
between the same starting and ending points, and the change in internal energy for each is the same—it is
independent of path.




FIGURE 15.4 Two different processes produce the same change in a system. (a) A total of 15.00 J of heat transfer occurs into the system,
while work takes out a total of 6.00 J. The change in internal energy is                               . (b) Heat transfer removes 150.00 J from
the system while work puts 159.00 J into it, producing an increase of 9.00 J in internal energy. If the system starts out in the same state in
(a) and (b), it will end up in the same final state in either case—its final state is related to internal energy, not how that energy was acquired.

Human Metabolism and the First Law of Thermodynamics
Human metabolism is the conversion of food into heat transfer, work, and stored fat. Metabolism is an interesting
example of the first law of thermodynamics in action. We now take another look at these topics via the first law of
thermodynamics. Considering the body as the system of interest, we can use the first law to examine heat transfer,
doing work, and internal energy in activities ranging from sleep to heavy exercise. What are some of the major
characteristics of heat transfer, doing work, and energy in the body? For one, body temperature is normally kept
constant by heat transfer to the surroundings. This means is negative. Another fact is that the body usually does
work on the outside world. This means       is positive. In such situations, then, the body loses internal energy, since
                is negative.
628   15 • Thermodynamics



      Now consider the effects of eating. Eating increases the internal energy of the body by adding chemical potential
      energy (this is an unromantic view of a good steak). The body metabolizes all the food we consume. Basically,
      metabolism is an oxidation process in which the chemical potential energy of food is released. This implies that food
      input is in the form of work. Food energy is reported in a special unit, known as the Calorie. This energy is measured
      by burning food in a calorimeter, which is how the units are determined.

      In chemistry and biochemistry, one calorie (spelled with a lowercase c) is defined as the energy (or heat transfer)
      required to raise the temperature of one gram of pure water by one degree Celsius. Nutritionists and weight-
      watchers tend to use the dietary calorie, which is frequently called a Calorie (spelled with a capital C). One food
      Calorie is the energy needed to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. This means
      that one dietary Calorie is equal to one kilocalorie for the chemist, and one must be careful to avoid confusion
      between the two.

      Again, consider the internal energy the body has lost. There are three places this internal energy can go—to heat
      transfer, to doing work, and to stored fat (a tiny fraction also goes to cell repair and growth). Heat transfer and doing
      work take internal energy out of the body, and food puts it back. If you eat just the right amount of food, then your
      average internal energy remains constant. Whatever you lose to heat transfer and doing work is replaced by food, so
      that, in the long run,        . If you overeat repeatedly, then       is always positive, and your body stores this extra
      internal energy as fat. The reverse is true if you eat too little. If   is negative for a few days, then the body
      metabolizes its own fat to maintain body temperature and do work that takes energy from the body. This process is
      how dieting produces weight loss.

      Life is not always this simple, as any dieter knows. The body stores fat or metabolizes it only if energy intake
      changes for a period of several days. Once you have been on a major diet, the next one is less successful because
      your body alters the way it responds to low energy intake. Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the rate at which food
      is converted into heat transfer and work done while the body is at complete rest. The body adjusts its basal
      metabolic rate to partially compensate for over-eating or under-eating. The body will decrease the metabolic rate
      rather than eliminate its own fat to replace lost food intake. You will chill more easily and feel less energetic as a
      result of the lower metabolic rate, and you will not lose weight as fast as before. Exercise helps to lose weight,
      because it produces both heat transfer from your body and work, and raises your metabolic rate even when you are
      at rest. Weight loss is also aided by the quite low efficiency of the body in converting internal energy to work, so that
      the loss of internal energy resulting from doing work is much greater than the work done.It should be noted,
      however, that living systems are not in thermalequilibrium.

      The body provides us with an excellent indication that many thermodynamic processes are irreversible. An
      irreversible process can go in one direction but not the reverse, under a given set of conditions. For example,
      although body fat can be converted to do work and produce heat transfer, work done on the body and heat transfer
      into it cannot be converted to body fat. Otherwise, we could skip lunch by sunning ourselves or by walking down
      stairs. Another example of an irreversible thermodynamic process is photosynthesis. This process is the intake of
      one form of energy—light—by plants and its conversion to chemical potential energy. Both applications of the first
      law of thermodynamics are illustrated in Figure 15.5. One great advantage of conservation laws such as the first law
      of thermodynamics is that they accurately describe the beginning and ending points of complex processes, such as
      metabolism and photosynthesis, without regard to the complications in between. Table 15.1 presents a summary of
      terms relevant to the first law of thermodynamics.

           be divided into many subcategories, such as thermal and chemical energy. Depends only on the state of

           is path independent.

           motion. Highly dependent on path. entering a system is positive.

           Work—energy transferred by a force moving through a distance. An organized, orderly process. Path
           dependent.      done by a system (either against an external force or to increase the volume of the
           system) is positive.

      FIGURE 15.6 Beginning with the Industrial Revolution, humans have harnessed power through the use of the first law of thermodynamics,
      before we even understood it completely. This photo, of a steam engine at the Turbinia Works, dates from 1911, a mere 61 years after the
      first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics by Rudolph Clausius. (credit: public domain; author unknown)

      One of the most important things we can do with heat transfer is to use it to do work for us. Such a device is called a
      heat engine. Car engines and steam turbines that generate electricity are examples of heat engines. Figure 15.7
      shows schematically how the first law of thermodynamics applies to the typical heat engine.

FIGURE 15.8 (a) Heat transfer to the gas in a cylinder increases the internal energy of the gas, creating higher pressure and temperature.
(b) The force exerted on the movable cylinder does work as the gas expands. Gas pressure and temperature decrease when it expands,
indicating that the gas’s internal energy has been decreased by doing work. (c) Heat transfer to the environment further reduces pressure in
the gas so that the piston can be more easily returned to its starting position.

The illustrations above show one of the ways in which heat transfer does work. Fuel combustion produces heat
transfer to a gas in a cylinder, increasing the pressure of the gas and thereby the force it exerts on a movable piston.
The gas does work on the outside world, as this force moves the piston through some distance. Heat transfer to the
gas cylinder results in work being done. To repeat this process, the piston needs to be returned to its starting point.
Heat transfer now occurs from the gas to the surroundings so that its pressure decreases, and a force is exerted by
the surroundings to push the piston back through some distance. Variations of this process are employed daily in
hundreds of millions of heat engines. We will examine heat engines in detail in the next section. In this section, we
consider some of the simpler underlying processes on which heat engines are based.

PV Diagrams and their Relationship to Work Done on or by a Gas
A process by which a gas does work on a piston at constant pressure is called an isobaric process. Since the
pressure is constant, the force exerted is constant and the work done is given as
                                                                                                                                   15.10

      FIGURE 15.9 An isobaric expansion of a gas requires heat transfer to keep the pressure constant. Since pressure is constant, the work done
      is    .

                                                                                                                                       15.11

      in volume; thus,

                                                                                                                                       15.13

      Note that if       is positive, then      is positive, meaning that work is done by the gas on the outside world.

      (Note that the pressure involved in this work that we’ve called is the pressure of the gas inside the tank. If we call
      the pressure outside the tank      , an expanding gas would be working against the external pressure; the work done
      would therefore be                    (isobaric process). Many texts use this definition of work, and not the definition
      based on internal pressure, as the basis of the First Law of Thermodynamics. This definition reverses the sign
      conventions for work, and results in a statement of the first law that becomes                   .)

      It is not surprising that           , since we have already noted in our treatment of fluids that pressure is a type of
      potential energy per unit volume and that pressure in fact has units of energy divided by volume. We also noted in
      our discussion of the ideal gas law that     has units of energy. In this case, some of the energy associated with
      pressure becomes work.

      Figure 15.10 shows a graph of pressure versus volume (that is, a     diagram for an isobaric process. You can see in
      the figure that the work done is the area under the graph. This property of  diagrams is very useful and broadly
      applicable: the work done on or by a system in going from one state to another equals the area under the curve on a
          diagram.

FIGURE 15.10 A graph of pressure versus volume for a constant-pressure, or isobaric, process, such as the one shown in Figure 15.9. The
area under the curve equals the work done by the gas, since          .




FIGURE 15.11 (a) A     diagram in which pressure varies as well as volume. The work done for each interval is its average pressure times
the change in volume, or the area under the curve over that interval. Thus the total area under the curve equals the total work done. (b)
Work must be done on the system to follow the reverse path. This is interpreted as a negative area under the curve.

We can see where this leads by considering Figure 15.11(a), which shows a more general process in which both
pressure and volume change. The area under the curve is closely approximated by dividing it into strips, each having
an average constant pressure       . The work done is                  for each strip, and the total work done is
the sum of the   . Thus the total work done is the total area under the curve. If the path is reversed, as in Figure
15.11(b), then work is done on the system. The area under the curve in that case is negative, because         is
negative.

     diagrams clearly illustrate that the work done depends on the path taken and not just the endpoints. This path
dependence is seen in Figure 15.12(a), where more work is done in going from A to C by the path via point B than by
the path via point D. The vertical paths, where volume is constant, are called isochoric processes. Since volume is
constant,           , and no work is done in an isochoric process. Now, if the system follows the cyclical path ABCDA,
as in Figure 15.12(b), then the total work done is the area inside the loop. The negative area below path CD
subtracts, leaving only the area inside the rectangle. In fact, the work done in any cyclical process (one that returns
to its starting point) is the area inside the loop it forms on a   diagram, as Figure 15.12(c) illustrates for a general
cyclical process. Note that the loop must be traversed in the clockwise direction for work to be positive—that is, for
634   15 • Thermodynamics



      there to be a net work output.




      FIGURE 15.12 (a) The work done in going from A to C depends on path. The work is greater for the path ABC than for the path ADC,
      because the former is at higher pressure. In both cases, the work done is the area under the path. This area is greater for path ABC. (b) The
      total work done in the cyclical process ABCDA is the area inside the loop, since the negative area below CD subtracts out, leaving just the
      area inside the rectangle. (The values given for the pressures and the change in volume are intended for use in the example below.) (c) The
      area inside any closed loop is the work done in the cyclical process. If the loop is traversed in a clockwise direction,    is positive—it is
      work done on the outside environment. If the loop is traveled in a counter-clockwise direction,        is negative—it is work that is done to the
      system.

Strategy

To find the work along any path on a         diagram, you use the fact that work is pressure times change in volume, or
            . So in part (a), this value is calculated for each leg of the path around the closed loop.

Solution for (a)

The work along path AB is


                                                                                                                  15.14

Since the path BC is isochoric,         , and so                  . The work along path CD is negative, since      is
negative (the volume decreases). The work is


                                                                                                                  15.15
                                                ×                      ×
Again, since the path DA is isochoric,              , and so             . Now the total work is

                                                                                                                  15.16

Solution for (b)

The area inside the rectangle is its height times its width, or



                                          ×                        ×                   ×                          15.17



Thus,
                                                                                                                  15.18
Discussion

The result, as anticipated, is that the area inside the closed loop equals the work done. The area is often easier to
calculate than is the work done along each path. It is also convenient to visualize the area inside different curves on
    diagrams in order to see which processes might produce the most work. Recall that work can be done to the
system, or by the system, depending on the sign of        . A positive  is work that is done by the system on the
outside environment; a negative        represents work done by the environment on the system.

Figure 15.13(a) shows two other important processes on a        diagram. For comparison, both are shown starting
from the same point A. The upper curve ending at point B is an isothermal process—that is, one in which
temperature is kept constant. If the gas behaves like an ideal gas, as is often the case, and if no phase change
occurs, then             . Since is constant,    is a constant for an isothermal process. We ordinarily expect the
temperature of a gas to decrease as it expands, and so we correctly suspect that heat transfer must occur from the
surroundings to the gas to keep the temperature constant during an isothermal expansion. To show this more
rigorously for the special case of a monatomic ideal gas, we note that the average kinetic energy of an atom in such
a gas is given by

                                                                                                                  15.19

The kinetic energy of the atoms in a monatomic ideal gas is its only form of internal energy, and so its total internal
energy is

                                                                                                                  15.20

      where      is the number of atoms in the gas. This relationship means that the internal energy of an ideal monatomic
      gas is constant during an isothermal process—that is,           . If the internal energy does not change, then the net
      heat transfer into the gas must equal the net work done by the gas. That is, because                        here,
               . We must have just enough heat transfer to replace the work done. An isothermal process is inherently
      slow, because heat transfer occurs continuously to keep the gas temperature constant at all times and must be
      allowed to spread through the gas so that there are no hot or cold regions.

      Note that diatomic gases, such as those in air, have different formulas for average kinetic energy of an atom and
      total internal energy.

      Also shown in Figure 15.13(a) is a curve AC for an adiabatic process, defined to be one in which there is no heat
      transfer—that is,      . Processes that are nearly adiabatic can be achieved either by using very effective insulation
      or by performing the process so fast that there is little time for heat transfer. Temperature must decrease during an
      adiabatic expansion process, since work is done at the expense of internal energy:

                                                                                                                                          15.21

      (You might have noted that a gas released into atmospheric pressure from a pressurized cylinder is substantially
      colder than the gas in the cylinder.) In fact, because                   for an adiabatic process. Lower temperature
      results in lower pressure along the way, so that curve AC is lower than curve AB, and less work is done. If the path
      ABCA could be followed by cooling the gas from B to C at constant volume (isochorically), Figure 15.13(b), there
      would be a net work output.




      FIGURE 15.13 (a) The upper curve is an isothermal process (          ), whereas the lower curve is an adiabatic process (      ). Both start
      from the same point A, but the isothermal process does more work than the adiabatic because heat transfer into the gas takes place to
      keep its temperature constant. This keeps the pressure higher all along the isothermal path than along the adiabatic path, producing more
      work. The adiabatic path thus ends up with a lower pressure and temperature at point C, even though the final volume is the same as for
      the isothermal process. (b) The cycle ABCA produces a net work output.



      Reversible Processes
      Both isothermal and adiabatic processes such as shown in Figure 15.13 are reversible in principle. A reversible
      process is one in which both the system and its environment can return to exactly the states they were in by
      following the reverse path. The reverse isothermal and adiabatic paths are BA and CA, respectively. Real

macroscopic processes are never exactly reversible. In the previous examples, our system is a gas (like that in
Figure 15.9), and its environment is the piston, cylinder, and the rest of the universe. If there are any energy-
dissipating mechanisms, such as friction or turbulence, then heat transfer to the environment occurs for either
direction of the piston. So, for example, if the path BA is followed and there is friction, then the gas will be returned
to its original state but the environment will not—it will have been heated in both directions. Reversibility requires
the direction of heat transfer to reverse for the reverse path. Since dissipative mechanisms cannot be completely
eliminated, real processes cannot be reversible.

There must be reasons that real macroscopic processes cannot be reversible. We can imagine them going in
reverse. For example, heat transfer occurs spontaneously from hot to cold and never spontaneously the reverse. Yet
it would not violate the first law of thermodynamics for this to happen. In fact, all spontaneous processes, such as
bubbles bursting, never go in reverse. There is a second thermodynamic law that forbids them from going in reverse.
When we study this law, we will learn something about nature and also find that such a law limits the efficiency of
heat engines. We will find that heat engines with the greatest possible theoretical efficiency would have to use
reversible processes, and even they cannot convert all heat transfer into doing work. Table 15.2 summarizes the
simpler thermodynamic processes and their definitions.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

      FIGURE 15.14 These ice floes melt during the Arctic summer. Some of them refreeze in the winter, but the second law of thermodynamics
      predicts that it would be extremely unlikely for the water molecules contained in these particular floes to reform the distinctive alligator-
      like shape they formed when the picture was taken in the summer of 2009. (credit: Patrick Kelley, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Geological Survey)

      The second law of thermodynamics deals with the direction taken by spontaneous processes. Many processes occur
      spontaneously in one direction only—that is, they are irreversible, under a given set of conditions. Although
      irreversibility is seen in day-to-day life—a broken glass does not resume its original state, for instance—complete
      irreversibility is a statistical statement that cannot be seen during the lifetime of the universe. More precisely, an
      irreversible process is one that depends on path. If the process can go in only one direction, then the reverse path
      differs fundamentally and the process cannot be reversible. For example, as noted in the previous section, heat
      involves the transfer of energy from higher to lower temperature. A cold object in contact with a hot one never gets
      colder, transferring heat to the hot object and making it hotter. Furthermore, mechanical energy, such as kinetic
      energy, can be completely converted to thermal energy by friction, but the reverse is impossible. A hot stationary
      object never spontaneously cools off and starts moving. Yet another example is the expansion of a puff of gas
      introduced into one corner of a vacuum chamber. The gas expands to fill the chamber, but it never regroups in the
      corner. The random motion of the gas molecules could take them all back to the corner, but this is never observed to
      happen. (See Figure 15.15.)

(b) The brakes of this car convert its kinetic energy to heat transfer to the environment. The reverse process is impossible. (c) The burst of
gas let into this vacuum chamber quickly expands to uniformly fill every part of the chamber. The random motions of the gas molecules will
never return them to the corner.

The fact that certain processes never occur suggests that there is a law forbidding them to occur. The first law of
thermodynamics would allow them to occur—none of those processes violate conservation of energy. The law that
forbids these processes is called the second law of thermodynamics. We shall see that the second law can be stated
in many ways that may seem different, but which in fact are equivalent. Like all natural laws, the second law of
thermodynamics gives insights into nature, and its several statements imply that it is broadly applicable,
fundamentally affecting many apparently disparate processes.

The already familiar direction of heat transfer from hot to cold is the basis of our first version of the second law of
thermodynamics.


  The Second Law of Thermodynamics (first expression)
  Heat transfer occurs spontaneously from higher- to lower-temperature bodies but never spontaneously in the
  reverse direction.


Another way of stating this: It is impossible for any process to have as its sole result heat transfer from a cooler to a
hotter object.

Heat Engines
Now let us consider a device that uses heat transfer to do work. As noted in the previous section, such a device is
called a heat engine, and one is shown schematically in Figure 15.16(b). Gasoline and diesel engines, jet engines,
and steam turbines are all heat engines that do work by using part of the heat transfer from some source. Heat
transfer from the hot object (or hot reservoir) is denoted as    , while heat transfer into the cold object (or cold
reservoir) is    , and the work done by the engine is    . The temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs are       and
   , respectively.
640   15 • Thermodynamics




      FIGURE 15.16 (a) Heat transfer occurs spontaneously from a hot object to a cold one, consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.
      (b) A heat engine, represented here by a circle, uses part of the heat transfer to do work. The hot and cold objects are called the hot and
      cold reservoirs.     is the heat transfer out of the hot reservoir,  is the work output, and     is the heat transfer into the cold reservoir.

      Because the hot reservoir is heated externally, which is energy intensive, it is important that the work is done as
      efficiently as possible. In fact, we would like     to equal  , and for there to be no heat transfer to the environment
      (         ). Unfortunately, this is impossible. The second law of thermodynamics also states, with regard to using
      heat transfer to do work (the second expression of the second law):


        The Second Law of Thermodynamics (second expression)
        It is impossible in any system for heat transfer from a reservoir to completely convert to work in a cyclical
        process in which the system returns to its initial state.


      A cyclical process brings a system, such as the gas in a cylinder, back to its original state at the end of every cycle.
      Most heat engines, such as reciprocating piston engines and rotating turbines, use cyclical processes. The second
      law, just stated in its second form, clearly states that such engines cannot have perfect conversion of heat transfer
      into work done. Before going into the underlying reasons for the limits on converting heat transfer into work, we
      need to explore the relationships among        ,   , and    , and to define the efficiency of a cyclical heat engine. As
      noted, a cyclical process brings the system back to its original condition at the end of every cycle. Such a system’s
      internal energy is the same at the beginning and end of every cycle—that is,                . The first law of
      thermodynamics states that
                                                                                                                                            15.22
      where       is the net heat transfer during the cycle (                        ) and       is the net work done by the system. Since
                 for a complete cycle, we have
                                                                                                                                            15.23
      so that
                                                                                                                                            15.24
      Thus the net work done by the system equals the net heat transfer into the system, or

                                                                                                                                            15.25

      just as shown schematically in Figure 15.16(b). The problem is that in all processes, there is some heat transfer
      to the environment—and usually a very significant amount at that.

      In the conversion of energy to work, we are always faced with the problem of getting less out than we put in. We
      define conversion efficiency      to be the ratio of useful work output to the energy input (or, in other words, the

ratio of what we get to what we spend). In that spirit, we define the efficiency of a heat engine to be its net work
output     divided by heat transfer to the engine    ; that is,

                                                                                                                        15.26

Since                     in a cyclical process, we can also express this as

                                                                                                                        15.27

making it clear that an efficiency of 1, or 100%, is possible only if there is no heat transfer to the environment
(       ). Note that all s are positive. The direction of heat transfer is indicated by a plus or minus sign. For
example,      is out of the system and so is preceded by a minus sign.


        EXAMPLE 15.3

Daily Work Done by a Coal-Fired Power Station, Its Efficiency and Carbon Dioxide Emissions
A coal-fired power station is a huge heat engine. It uses heat transfer from burning coal to do work to turn turbines,
which are used to generate electricity. In a single day, a large coal power station has                of heat transfer
from coal and                  of heat transfer into the environment. (a) What is the work done by the power station?
(b) What is the efficiency of the power station? (c) In the combustion process, the following chemical reaction
occurs:               . This implies that every 12 kg of coal puts 12 kg + 16 kg + 16 kg = 44 kg of carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere. Assuming that 1 kg of coal can provide                  of heat transfer upon combustion, how much
    is emitted per day by this power plant?

Strategy for (a)

We can use                   to find the work output   , assuming a cyclical process is used in the power station. In
this process, water is boiled under pressure to form high-temperature steam, which is used to run steam turbine-
generators, and then condensed back to water to start the cycle again.

Solution for (a)

Work output is given by:
                                                                                                                        15.28
Substituting the given values:

                                                           ×               ×
                                                                                                                        15.29


Strategy for (b)

The efficiency can be calculated with                  since     is given and work       was found in the first part of this
example.

Solution for (b)

Efficiency is given by:              . The work      was just found to be                  , and     is given, so the
efficiency is


                                                                                                                        15.30
642   15 • Thermodynamics



      Strategy for (c)

      The daily consumption of coal is calculated using the information that each day there is      ×         of heat
      transfer from coal. In the combustion process, we have                . So every 12 kg of coal puts 12 kg + 16 kg + 16
      kg = 44 kg of    into the atmosphere.

      Solution for (c)

      The daily coal consumption is

                                                       ×
                                                                        ×                                               15.31
                                                      ×
      Assuming that the coal is pure and that all the coal goes toward producing carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide
      produced per day is

                                         ×                ×                  ×                                          15.32

      This is 370,000 metric tons of     produced every day.

      Discussion

      If all the work output is converted to electricity in a period of one day, the average power output is 1180 MW (this is
      left to you as an end-of-chapter problem). This value is about the size of a large-scale conventional power plant. The
      efficiency found is acceptably close to the value of 42% given for coal power stations. It means that fully 59.2% of
      the energy is heat transfer to the environment, which usually results in warming lakes, rivers, or the ocean near the
      power station, and is implicated in a warming planet generally. While the laws of thermodynamics limit the
      efficiency of such plants—including plants fired by nuclear fuel, oil, and natural gas—the heat transfer to the
      environment could be, and sometimes is, used for heating homes or for industrial processes. The generally low cost
      of energy has not made it economical to make better use of the waste heat transfer from most heat engines. Coal-
      fired power plants produce the greatest amount of           per unit energy output (compared to natural gas or oil),
      making coal the least efficient fossil fuel.


      With the information given in Example 15.3, we can find characteristics such as the efficiency of a heat engine
      without any knowledge of how the heat engine operates, but looking further into the mechanism of the engine will
      give us greater insight. Figure 15.17 illustrates the operation of the common four-stroke gasoline engine. The four
      steps shown complete this heat engine’s cycle, bringing the gasoline-air mixture back to its original condition.

      The Otto cycle shown in Figure 15.18(a) is used in four-stroke internal combustion engines, although in fact the true
      Otto cycle paths do not correspond exactly to the strokes of the engine.

      The adiabatic process AB corresponds to the nearly adiabatic compression stroke of the gasoline engine. In both
      cases, work is done on the system (the gas mixture in the cylinder), increasing its temperature and pressure. Along
      path BC of the Otto cycle, heat transfer     into the gas occurs at constant volume, causing a further increase in
      pressure and temperature. This process corresponds to burning fuel in an internal combustion engine, and takes
      place so rapidly that the volume is nearly constant. Path CD in the Otto cycle is an adiabatic expansion that does
      work on the outside world, just as the power stroke of an internal combustion engine does in its nearly adiabatic
      expansion. The work done by the system along path CD is greater than the work done on the system along path AB,
      because the pressure is greater, and so there is a net work output. Along path DA in the Otto cycle, heat transfer
      from the gas at constant volume reduces its temperature and pressure, returning it to its original state. In an internal
      combustion engine, this process corresponds to the exhaust of hot gases and the intake of an air-gasoline mixture at
      a considerably lower temperature. In both cases, heat transfer into the environment occurs along this final path.

      The net work done by a cyclical process is the area inside the closed path on a      diagram, such as that inside path
      ABCDA in Figure 15.18. Note that in every imaginable cyclical process, it is absolutely necessary for heat transfer
      from the system to occur in order to get a net work output. In the Otto cycle, heat transfer occurs along path DA. If

no heat transfer occurs, then the return path is the same, and the net work output is zero. The lower the
temperature on the path AB, the less work has to be done to compress the gas. The area inside the closed path is
then greater, and so the engine does more work and is thus more efficient. Similarly, the higher the temperature
along path CD, the more work output there is. (See Figure 15.19.) So efficiency is related to the temperatures of the
hot and cold reservoirs. In the next section, we shall see what the absolute limit to the efficiency of a heat engine is,
and how it is related to temperature.




FIGURE 15.17 In the four-stroke internal combustion gasoline engine, heat transfer into work takes place in the cyclical process shown
here. The piston is connected to a rotating crankshaft, which both takes work out of and does work on the gas in the cylinder. (a) Air is
mixed with fuel during the intake stroke. (b) During the compression stroke, the air-fuel mixture is rapidly compressed in a nearly adiabatic
process, as the piston rises with the valves closed. Work is done on the gas. (c) The power stroke has two distinct parts. First, the air-fuel
mixture is ignited, converting chemical potential energy into thermal energy almost instantaneously, which leads to a great increase in
pressure. Then the piston descends, and the gas does work by exerting a force through a distance in a nearly adiabatic process. (d) The
exhaust stroke expels the hot gas to prepare the engine for another cycle, starting again with the intake stroke.

the start of the compression stroke of an internal combustion engine. Paths AB and CD are adiabatic and correspond to the compression
and power strokes of an internal combustion engine, respectively. Paths BC and DA are isochoric and accomplish similar results to the
ignition and exhaust-intake portions, respectively, of the internal combustion engine’s cycle. Work is done on the gas along path AB, but
more work is done by the gas along path CD, so that there is a net work output.

higher and the starting temperature of path AB is lower. The area inside the loop is greater, corresponding to greater net work output.

      15.4 Carnot’s Perfect Heat Engine: The Second Law of Thermodynamics
      Restated
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Identify a Carnot cycle.
       • Calculate maximum theoretical efficiency of a nuclear reactor.
       • Explain how dissipative processes affect the ideal Carnot engine.




      FIGURE 15.20 This novelty toy, known as the drinking bird, is an example of Carnot’s engine. It contains methylene chloride (mixed with a
      dye) in the abdomen, which boils at a very low temperature—about         . To operate, one gets the bird’s head wet. As the water
      evaporates, fluid moves up into the head, causing the bird to become top-heavy and dip forward back into the water. This cools down the
      methylene chloride in the head, and it moves back into the abdomen, causing the bird to become bottom heavy and tip up. Except for a very
      small input of energy—the original head-wetting—the bird becomes a perpetual motion machine of sorts. (credit: Arabesk.nl, Wikimedia

      We know from the second law of thermodynamics that a heat engine cannot be 100% efficient, since there must
      always be some heat transfer      to the environment, which is often called waste heat. How efficient, then, can a
      heat engine be? This question was answered at a theoretical level in 1824 by a young French engineer, Sadi Carnot
      (1796–1832), in his study of the then-emerging heat engine technology crucial to the Industrial Revolution. He
      devised a theoretical cycle, now called the Carnot cycle, which is the most efficient cyclical process possible. The
      second law of thermodynamics can be restated in terms of the Carnot cycle, and so what Carnot actually discovered
      was this fundamental law. Any heat engine employing the Carnot cycle is called a Carnot engine.

      What is crucial to the Carnot cycle—and, in fact, defines it—is that only reversible processes are used. Irreversible
      processes involve dissipative factors, such as friction and turbulence. This increases heat transfer     to the
      environment and reduces the efficiency of the engine. Obviously, then, reversible processes are superior.


        Carnot Engine
        Stated in terms of reversible processes, the second law of thermodynamics has a third form:

        A Carnot engine operating between two given temperatures has the greatest possible efficiency of any heat
        engine operating between these two temperatures. Furthermore, all engines employing only reversible
        processes have this same maximum efficiency when operating between the same given temperatures.


      Figure 15.21 shows the      diagram for a Carnot cycle. The cycle comprises two isothermal and two adiabatic
      processes. Recall that both isothermal and adiabatic processes are, in principle, reversible.

Carnot also determined the efficiency of a perfect heat engine—that is, a Carnot engine. It is always true that the
efficiency of a cyclical heat engine is given by:

                                                                                                                                15.33

What Carnot found was that for a perfect heat engine, the ratio         equals the ratio of the absolute temperatures
of the heat reservoirs. That is,               for a Carnot engine, so that the maximum or Carnot efficiency
       is given by

                                                                                                                                15.34

where      and     are in kelvins (or any other absolute temperature scale). No real heat engine can do as well as the
Carnot efficiency—an actual efficiency of about 0.7 of this maximum is usually the best that can be accomplished.
But the ideal Carnot engine, like the drinking bird above, while a fascinating novelty, has zero power. This makes it
unrealistic for any applications.

Carnot’s interesting result implies that 100% efficiency would be possible only if             —that is, only if the cold
reservoir were at absolute zero, a practical and theoretical impossibility. But the physical implication is this—the
only way to have all heat transfer go into doing work is to remove all thermal energy, and this requires a cold
reservoir at absolute zero.

It is also apparent that the greatest efficiencies are obtained when the ratio           is as small as possible. Just as
discussed for the Otto cycle in the previous section, this means that efficiency is greatest for the highest possible
temperature of the hot reservoir and lowest possible temperature of the cold reservoir. (This setup increases the
area inside the closed loop on the        diagram; also, it seems reasonable that the greater the temperature
difference, the easier it is to divert the heat transfer to work.) The actual reservoir temperatures of a heat engine are
usually related to the type of heat source and the temperature of the environment into which heat transfer occurs.
Consider the following example.




FIGURE 15.21       diagram for a Carnot cycle, employing only reversible isothermal and adiabatic processes. Heat transfer    occurs into
the working substance during the isothermal path AB, which takes place at constant temperature . Heat transfer         occurs out of the
working substance during the isothermal path CD, which takes place at constant temperature . The net work output         equals the area
inside the path ABCDA. Also shown is a schematic of a Carnot engine operating between hot and cold reservoirs at temperatures       and
. Any heat engine using reversible processes and operating between these two temperatures will have the same maximum efficiency as the
Carnot engine.


        EXAMPLE 15.4

Maximum Theoretical Efficiency for a Nuclear Reactor
A nuclear power reactor has pressurized water at                  . (Higher temperatures are theoretically possible but
646   15 • Thermodynamics



      practically not, due to limitations with materials used in the reactor.) Heat transfer from this water is a complex
      process (see Figure 15.22). Steam, produced in the steam generator, is used to drive the turbine-generators.
      Eventually the steam is condensed to water at         and then heated again to start the cycle over. Calculate the
      maximum theoretical efficiency for a heat engine operating between these two temperatures.




      FIGURE 15.22 Schematic diagram of a pressurized water nuclear reactor and the steam turbines that convert work into electrical energy.
      Heat exchange is used to generate steam, in part to avoid contamination of the generators with radioactivity. Two turbines are used
      because this is less expensive than operating a single generator that produces the same amount of electrical energy. The steam is
      condensed to liquid before being returned to the heat exchanger, to keep exit steam pressure low and aid the flow of steam through the
      turbines (equivalent to using a lower-temperature cold reservoir). The considerable energy associated with condensation must be
      dissipated into the local environment; in this example, a cooling tower is used so there is no direct heat transfer to an aquatic environment.
      (Note that the water going to the cooling tower does not come into contact with the steam flowing over the turbines.)

      Strategy

      Since temperatures are given for the hot and cold reservoirs of this heat engine,                                       can be used to
      calculate the Carnot (maximum theoretical) efficiency. Those temperatures must first be converted to kelvins.

      Solution

      The hot and cold reservoir temperatures are given as                      and           , respectively. In kelvins, then,
      and             , so that the maximum efficiency is

                                                                                                                                           15.35

      Thus,


                                                                                                                                           15.36


      Discussion

      A typical nuclear power station’s actual efficiency is about 35%, a little better than 0.7 times the maximum possible
      value, a tribute to superior engineering. Electrical power stations fired by coal, oil, and natural gas have greater
      actual efficiencies (about 42%), because their boilers can reach higher temperatures and pressures. The cold
      reservoir temperature in any of these power stations is limited by the local environment. Figure 15.23 shows (a) the
      exterior of a nuclear power station and (b) the exterior of a coal-fired power station. Both have cooling towers into
      which water from the condenser enters the tower near the top and is sprayed downward, cooled by evaporation.

Since all real processes are irreversible, the actual efficiency of a heat engine can never be as great as that of a
Carnot engine, as illustrated in Figure 15.24(a). Even with the best heat engine possible, there are always dissipative
processes in peripheral equipment, such as electrical transformers or car transmissions. These further reduce the
overall efficiency by converting some of the engine’s work output back into heat transfer, as shown in Figure
15.24(b).

      15.5 Applications of Thermodynamics: Heat Pumps and Refrigerators
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Describe the use of heat engines in heat pumps and refrigerators.
       • Demonstrate how a heat pump works to warm an interior space.
       • Explain the differences between heat pumps and refrigerators.
       • Calculate a heat pump’s coefficient of performance.

      Heat pumps, air conditioners, and refrigerators utilize heat transfer from cold to hot. They are heat engines run
      backward. We say backward, rather than reverse, because except for Carnot engines, all heat engines, though they
      can be run backward, cannot truly be reversed. Heat transfer occurs from a cold reservoir          and into a hot one.
      This requires work input     , which is also converted to heat transfer. Thus the heat transfer to the hot reservoir is
                      . (Note that    ,    , and     are positive, with their directions indicated on schematics rather than by
      sign.) A heat pump’s mission is for heat transfer      to occur into a warm environment, such as a home in the winter.
      The mission of air conditioners and refrigerators is for heat transfer       to occur from a cool environment, such as
      chilling a room or keeping food at lower temperatures than the environment. (Actually, a heat pump can be used

both to heat and cool a space. It is essentially an air conditioner and a heating unit all in one. In this section we will
concentrate on its heating mode.)

15.27 but reversed, following path ADCBA. The area inside the loop is negative, meaning there is a net work input. There is heat transfer
into the system from a cold reservoir along path DC, and heat transfer     out of the system into a hot reservoir along path BA.

Heat Pumps
The great advantage of using a heat pump to keep your home warm, rather than just burning fuel, is that a heat
pump supplies                  . Heat transfer is from the outside air, even at a temperature below freezing, to the
indoor space. You only pay for    , and you get an additional heat transfer of      from the outside at no cost; in many
cases, at least twice as much energy is transferred to the heated space as is used to run the heat pump. When you
burn fuel to keep warm, you pay for all of it. The disadvantage is that the work input (required by the second law of
thermodynamics) is sometimes more expensive than simply burning fuel, especially if the work is done by electrical
energy.

The basic components of a heat pump in its heating mode are shown in Figure 15.27. A working fluid such as a non-
CFC refrigerant is used. In the outdoor coils (the evaporator), heat transfer occurs to the working fluid from the
cold outdoor air, turning it into a gas.




FIGURE 15.27 A simple heat pump has four basic components: (1) condenser, (2) expansion valve, (3) evaporator, and (4) compressor. In
the heating mode, heat transfer      occurs to the working fluid in the evaporator (3) from the colder outdoor air, turning it into a gas. The
electrically driven compressor (4) increases the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the condenser coils (1) inside the
heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature in the room, heat transfer from the gas to the room
650   15 • Thermodynamics



      occurs as the gas condenses to a liquid. The working fluid is then cooled as it flows back through an expansion valve (2) to the outdoor
      evaporator coils.

      The electrically driven compressor (work input    ) raises the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into
      the condenser coils that are inside the heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the
      temperature inside the room, heat transfer to the room occurs and the gas condenses to a liquid. The liquid then
      flows back through a pressure-reducing valve to the outdoor evaporator coils, being cooled through expansion. (In a
      cooling cycle, the evaporator and condenser coils exchange roles and the flow direction of the fluid is reversed.)

      The quality of a heat pump is judged by how much heat transfer            occurs into the warm space compared with how
      much work input       is required. In the spirit of taking the ratio of what you get to what you spend, we define a heat
      pump’s coefficient of performance (              ) to be

                                                                                                                                          15.37

      Since the efficiency of a heat engine is                         , we see that                        , an important and interesting
      fact. First, since the efficiency of any heat engine is less than 1, it means that                     is always greater than 1—that
      is, a heat pump always has more heat transfer     than work put into it. Second, it means that heat pumps work best
      when temperature differences are small. The efficiency of a perfect, or Carnot, engine is                   ; thus,
      the smaller the temperature difference, the smaller the efficiency and the greater the        (because
                           ). In other words, heat pumps do not work as well in very cold climates as they do in more
      moderate climates.

      Friction and other irreversible processes reduce heat engine efficiency, but they do not benefit the operation of a
      heat pump—instead, they reduce the work input by converting part of it to heat transfer back into the cold reservoir
      before it gets into the heat pump.




      FIGURE 15.28 When a real heat engine is run backward, some of the intended work input     goes into heat transfer before it gets into the
      heat engine, thereby reducing its coefficient of performance    . In this figure,  represents the portion of   that goes into the heat
      pump, while the remainder of     is lost in the form of frictional heat  to the cold reservoir. If all of had gone into the heat pump,
      then     would have been greater. The best heat pump uses adiabatic and isothermal processes, since, in theory, there would be no
      dissipative processes to reduce the heat transfer to the hot reservoir.


              EXAMPLE 15.5

      The Best COP hp of a Heat Pump for Home Use
      A heat pump used to warm a home must employ a cycle that produces a working fluid at temperatures greater than
      typical indoor temperature so that heat transfer to the inside can take place. Similarly, it must produce a working
      fluid at temperatures that are colder than the outdoor temperature so that heat transfer occurs from outside. Its hot
      and cold reservoir temperatures therefore cannot be too close, placing a limit on its          . (See Figure 15.29.)

What is the best coefficient of performance possible for such a heat pump, if it has a hot reservoir temperature of
       and a cold reservoir temperature of          ?

Strategy

A Carnot engine reversed will give the best possible performance as a heat pump. As noted above,
                 , so that we need to first calculate the Carnot efficiency to solve this problem.

Solution

Carnot efficiency in terms of absolute temperature is given by:

                                                                                                                               15.38

The temperatures in kelvins are                     and                 , so that

                                                                                                                               15.39

Thus, from the discussion above,

                                                                                                                               15.40

or

                                                                                                                               15.41

so that
                                                                                                                               15.42

Discussion

This result means that the heat transfer by the heat pump is 5.30 times as much as the work put into it. It would
cost 5.30 times as much for the same heat transfer by an electric room heater as it does for that produced by this
heat pump. This is not a violation of conservation of energy. Cold ambient air provides 4.3 J per 1 J of work from the
electrical outlet.




FIGURE 15.29 Heat transfer from the outside to the inside, along with work done to run the pump, takes place in the heat pump of the
example above. Note that the cold temperature produced by the heat pump is lower than the outside temperature, so that heat transfer
into the working fluid occurs. The pump’s compressor produces a temperature greater than the indoor temperature in order for heat
transfer into the house to occur.



Real heat pumps do not perform quite as well as the ideal one in the previous example; their values of                          range
from about 2 to 4. This range means that the heat transfer              from the heat pumps is 2 to 4 times as great as the
652   15 • Thermodynamics



      work     put into them. Their economical feasibility is still limited, however, since  is usually supplied by electrical
      energy that costs more per joule than heat transfer by burning fuels like natural gas. Furthermore, the initial cost of a
      heat pump is greater than that of many furnaces, so that a heat pump must last longer for its cost to be recovered.
      Heat pumps are most likely to be economically superior where winter temperatures are mild, electricity is relatively
      cheap, and other fuels are relatively expensive. Also, since they can cool as well as heat a space, they have
      advantages where cooling in summer months is also desired. Thus some of the best locations for heat pumps are in
      warm summer climates with cool winters. Figure 15.30 shows a heat pump, called a “reverse cycle” or “split-system
      cooler” in some countries.




      FIGURE 15.30 In hot weather, heat transfer occurs from air inside the room to air outside, cooling the room. In cool weather, heat transfer
      occurs from air outside to air inside, warming the room. This switching is achieved by reversing the direction of flow of the working fluid.

      Air Conditioners and Refrigerators
      Air conditioners and refrigerators are designed to cool something down in a warm environment. As with heat pumps,
      work input is required for heat transfer from cold to hot, and this is expensive. The quality of air conditioners and
      refrigerators is judged by how much heat transfer      occurs from a cold environment compared with how much
      work input      is required. What is considered the benefit in a heat pump is considered waste heat in a refrigerator.
      We thus define the coefficient of performance               of an air conditioner or refrigerator to be

                                                                                                                                          15.43

      Noting again that                       , we can see that an air conditioner will have a lower coefficient of performance
      than a heat pump, because                            and     is greater than     . In this module’s Problems and Exercises,
      you will show that

                                                                                                                                          15.44

      for a heat engine used as either an air conditioner or a heat pump operating between the same two temperatures.
      Real air conditioners and refrigerators typically do remarkably well, having values of      ranging from 2 to 6.
      These numbers are better than the            values for the heat pumps mentioned above, because the temperature
      differences are smaller, but they are less than those for Carnot engines operating between the same two
      temperatures.

      A type of         rating system called the “energy efficiency rating” (       ) has been developed. This rating is an
      example where non-SI units are still used and relevant to consumers. To make it easier for the consumer, Australia,
      Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S. use an Energy Star Rating out of 5 stars—the more stars, the more energy
      efficient the appliance.         are expressed in mixed units of British thermal units (Btu) per hour of heating or
      cooling divided by the power input in watts. Room air conditioners are readily available with              ranging from 6 to
      12. Although not the same as the            just described, these        are good for comparison purposes—the greater
      the        , the cheaper an air conditioner is to operate (but the higher its purchase price is likely to be).

      The         of an air conditioner or refrigerator can be expressed as

                                                                                                                                          15.45

where      is the amount of heat transfer from a cold environment in British thermal units,                     is time in hours,       is
the work input in joules, and is time in seconds.


  Problem-Solving Strategies for Thermodynamics
  1. Examine the situation to determine whether heat, work, or internal energy are involved. Look for any system
     where the primary methods of transferring energy are heat and work. Heat engines, heat pumps,
     refrigerators, and air conditioners are examples of such systems.
  2. Identify the system of interest and draw a labeled diagram of the system showing energy flow.
  3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is
     useful. Maximum efficiency means a Carnot engine is involved. Efficiency is not the same as the coefficient
     of performance.
  4. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). Be sure to
     distinguish heat transfer into a system from heat transfer out of the system, as well as work input from work
     output. In many situations, it is useful to determine the type of process, such as isothermal or adiabatic.
  5. Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown).
  6. Substitute the known quantities along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical
     solutions complete with units.
  7. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? For example, efficiency is always less than
     1, whereas coefficients of performance are greater than 1.


15.6 Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics: Disorder and the
Unavailability of Energy
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define entropy and calculate the increase of entropy in a system with reversible and irreversible
    processes.
 • Explain the expected fate of the universe in entropic terms.
 • Calculate the increasing disorder of a system.

thermodynamics. (credit: Jon Sullivan, PDPhoto.org)

There is yet another way of expressing the second law of thermodynamics. This version relates to a concept called
entropy. By examining it, we shall see that the directions associated with the second law—heat transfer from hot to
cold, for example—are related to the tendency in nature for systems to become disordered and for less energy to be
available for use as work. The entropy of a system can in fact be shown to be a measure of its disorder and of the
unavailability of energy to do work.
654   15 • Thermodynamics




        Making Connections: Entropy, Energy, and Work
        Recall that the simple definition of energy is the ability to do work. Entropy is a measure of how much energy is
        not available to do work. Although all forms of energy are interconvertible, and all can be used to do work, it is
        not always possible, even in principle, to convert the entire available energy into work. That unavailable energy is
        of interest in thermodynamics, because the field of thermodynamics arose from efforts to convert heat to work.


      We can see how entropy is defined by recalling our discussion of the Carnot engine. We noted that for a Carnot cycle,
      and hence for any reversible processes,                 . Rearranging terms yields

                                                                                                                                  15.46

      for any reversible process.       and      are absolute values of the heat transfer at temperatures      and            ,
      respectively. This ratio of       is defined to be the change in entropy       for a reversible process,

                                                                                                                                  15.47

      where is the heat transfer, which is positive for heat transfer into and negative for heat transfer out of, and is
      the absolute temperature at which the reversible process takes place. The SI unit for entropy is joules per kelvin (J/
      K). If temperature changes during the process, then it is usually a good approximation (for small changes in
      temperature) to take to be the average temperature, avoiding the need to use integral calculus to find         .

      The definition of     is strictly valid only for reversible processes, such as used in a Carnot engine. However, we can
      find     precisely even for real, irreversible processes. The reason is that the entropy of a system, like internal
      energy , depends only on the state of the system and not how it reached that condition. Entropy is a property of
      state. Thus the change in entropy         of a system between state 1 and state 2 is the same no matter how the
      change occurs. We just need to find or imagine a reversible process that takes us from state 1 to state 2 and
      calculate     for that process. That will be the change in entropy for any process going from state 1 to state 2. (See
      Figure 15.32.)




      FIGURE 15.32 When a system goes from state 1 to state 2, its entropy changes by the same amount   , whether a hypothetical reversible
      path is followed or a real irreversible path is taken.

      Now let us take a look at the change in entropy of a Carnot engine and its heat reservoirs for one full cycle. The hot
      reservoir has a loss of entropy                 , because heat transfer occurs out of it (remember that when heat
      transfers out, then has a negative sign). The cold reservoir has a gain of entropy                  , because heat
      transfer occurs into it. (We assume the reservoirs are sufficiently large that their temperatures are constant.) So the
      total change in entropy is

                              15.6 • Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics: Disorder and the Unavailability of Energy   655



                                                                                                                   15.48
Thus, since we know that                    for a Carnot engine,

                                                                                                                   15.49

This result, which has general validity, means that the total change in entropy for a system in any reversible process
is zero.

The entropy of various parts of the system may change, but the total change is zero. Furthermore, the system does
not affect the entropy of its surroundings, since heat transfer between them does not occur. Thus the reversible
process changes neither the total entropy of the system nor the entropy of its surroundings. Sometimes this is
stated as follows: Reversible processes do not affect the total entropy of the universe. Real processes are not
reversible, though, and they do change total entropy. We can, however, use hypothetical reversible processes to
determine the value of entropy in real, irreversible processes. The following example illustrates this point.


       EXAMPLE 15.6

Entropy Increases in an Irreversible (Real) Process
Spontaneous heat transfer from hot to cold is an irreversible process. Calculate the total change in entropy if 4000 J
of heat transfer occurs from a hot reservoir at                     to a cold reservoir at                       ,
assuming there is no temperature change in either reservoir. (See Figure 15.33.)

Strategy

How can we calculate the change in entropy for an irreversible process when                            is valid only for
reversible processes? Remember that the total change in entropy of the hot and cold reservoirs will be the same
whether a reversible or irreversible process is involved in heat transfer from hot to cold. So we can calculate the
change in entropy of the hot reservoir for a hypothetical reversible process in which 4000 J of heat transfer occurs
from it; then we do the same for a hypothetical reversible process in which 4000 J of heat transfer occurs to the cold
reservoir. This produces the same changes in the hot and cold reservoirs that would occur if the heat transfer were
allowed to occur irreversibly between them, and so it also produces the same changes in entropy.

Solution

We now calculate the two changes in entropy using                            . First, for the heat transfer from the hot
reservoir,

                                                                                                                   15.50

And for the cold reservoir,

                                                                                                                   15.51

Thus the total is


                                                                                                                   15.52


Discussion

There is an increase in entropy for the system of two heat reservoirs undergoing this irreversible heat transfer. We
will see that this means there is a loss of ability to do work with this transferred energy. Entropy has increased, and
energy has become unavailable to do work.
656   15 • Thermodynamics




      FIGURE 15.33 (a) Heat transfer from a hot object to a cold one is an irreversible process that produces an overall increase in entropy. (b)
      The same final state and, thus, the same change in entropy is achieved for the objects if reversible heat transfer processes occur between
      the two objects whose temperatures are the same as the temperatures of the corresponding objects in the irreversible process.



      It is reasonable that entropy increases for heat transfer from hot to cold. Since the change in entropy is     , there
      is a larger change at lower temperatures. The decrease in entropy of the hot object is therefore less than the
      increase in entropy of the cold object, producing an overall increase, just as in the previous example. This result is
      very general:

      There is an increase in entropy for any system undergoing an irreversible process.

      With respect to entropy, there are only two possibilities: entropy is constant for a reversible process, and it increases
      for an irreversible process. There is a fourth version of the second law of thermodynamics stated in terms of
      entropy:

      The total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in any process; it never decreases.

      For example, heat transfer cannot occur spontaneously from cold to hot, because entropy would decrease.

      Entropy is very different from energy. Entropy is not conserved but increases in all real processes. Reversible
      processes (such as in Carnot engines) are the processes in which the most heat transfer to work takes place and are
      also the ones that keep entropy constant. Thus we are led to make a connection between entropy and the
      availability of energy to do work.

      Entropy and the Unavailability of Energy to Do Work
      What does a change in entropy mean, and why should we be interested in it? One reason is that entropy is directly
      related to the fact that not all heat transfer can be converted into work. The next example gives some indication of
      how an increase in entropy results in less heat transfer into work.


              EXAMPLE 15.7

      Less Work is Produced by a Given Heat Transfer When Entropy Change is Greater
      (a) Calculate the work output of a Carnot engine operating between temperatures of 600 K and 100 K for 4000 J of
      heat transfer to the engine. (b) Now suppose that the 4000 J of heat transfer occurs first from the 600 K reservoir to
      a 250 K reservoir (without doing any work, and this produces the increase in entropy calculated above) before

transferring into a Carnot engine operating between 250 K and 100 K. What work output is produced? (See Figure
15.34.)

Strategy

In both parts, we must first calculate the Carnot efficiency and then the work output.

Solution (a)

The Carnot efficiency is given by

                                                                                                                  15.53

Substituting the given temperatures yields

                                                                                                                  15.54

Now the work output can be calculated using the definition of efficiency for any heat engine as given by

                                                                                                                  15.55

Solving for    and substituting known terms gives

                                                                                                                  15.56

Solution (b)

Similarly,


                                                                                                                  15.57
                                                     ′
so that

                                                                                                                  15.58

Discussion

There is 933 J less work from the same heat transfer in the second process. This result is important. The same heat
transfer into two perfect engines produces different work outputs, because the entropy change differs in the two
cases. In the second case, entropy is greater and less work is produced. Entropy is associated with the unavailability
of energy to do work.
658   15 • Thermodynamics




      FIGURE 15.34 (a) A Carnot engine working at between 600 K and 100 K has 4000 J of heat transfer and performs 3333 J of work. (b) The
      4000 J of heat transfer occurs first irreversibly to a 250 K reservoir and then goes into a Carnot engine. The increase in entropy caused by
      the heat transfer to a colder reservoir results in a smaller work output of 2400 J. There is a permanent loss of 933 J of energy for the
      purpose of doing work.



      When entropy increases, a certain amount of energy becomes permanently unavailable to do work. The energy is
      not lost, but its character is changed, so that some of it can never be converted to doing work—that is, to an
      organized force acting through a distance. For instance, in the previous example, 933 J less work was done after an
      increase in entropy of 9.33 J/K occurred in the 4000 J heat transfer from the 600 K reservoir to the 250 K reservoir.
      It can be shown that the amount of energy that becomes unavailable for work is
                                                                                                                                           15.59
      where       is the lowest temperature utilized. In the previous example,
                                                                                                                                           15.60
      as found.

      Heat Death of the Universe: An Overdose of Entropy
      In the early, energetic universe, all matter and energy were easily interchangeable and identical in nature. Gravity
      played a vital role in the young universe. Although it may have seemed disorderly, and therefore, superficially
      entropic, in fact, there was enormous potential energy available to do work—all the future energy in the universe.

      As the universe matured, temperature differences arose, which created more opportunity for work. Stars are hotter
      than planets, for example, which are warmer than icy asteroids, which are warmer still than the vacuum of the space
      between them.

      Most of these are cooling down from their usually violent births, at which time they were provided with energy of
      their own—nuclear energy in the case of stars, volcanic energy on Earth and other planets, and so on. Without
      additional energy input, however, their days are numbered.

      As entropy increases, less and less energy in the universe is available to do work. On Earth, we still have great stores
      of energy such as fossil and nuclear fuels; large-scale temperature differences, which can provide wind energy;
      geothermal energies due to differences in temperature in Earth’s layers; and tidal energies owing to our abundance
      of liquid water. As these are used, a certain fraction of the energy they contain can never be converted into doing
      work. Eventually, all fuels will be exhausted, all temperatures will equalize, and it will be impossible for heat engines
      to function, or for work to be done.

      Entropy increases in a closed system, such as the universe. But in parts of the universe, for instance, in the Solar
      system, it is not a locally closed system. Energy flows from the Sun to the planets, replenishing Earth’s stores of
      energy. The Sun will continue to supply us with energy for about another five billion years. We will enjoy direct solar
      energy, as well as side effects of solar energy, such as wind power and biomass energy from photosynthetic plants.
      The energy from the Sun will keep our water at the liquid state, and the Moon’s gravitational pull will continue to

provide tidal energy. But Earth’s geothermal energy will slowly run down and won’t be replenished.

But in terms of the universe, and the very long-term, very large-scale picture, the entropy of the universe is
increasing, and so the availability of energy to do work is constantly decreasing. Eventually, when all stars have died,
all forms of potential energy have been utilized, and all temperatures have equalized (depending on the mass of the
universe, either at a very high temperature following a universal contraction, or a very low one, just before all activity
ceases) there will be no possibility of doing work.

Either way, the universe is destined for thermodynamic equilibrium—maximum entropy. This is often called the heat
death of the universe, and will mean the end of all activity. However, whether the universe contracts and heats up, or
continues to expand and cools down, the end is not near. Calculations of black holes suggest that entropy can easily
continue for at least       years.

Order to Disorder
Entropy is related not only to the unavailability of energy to do work—it is also a measure of disorder. This notion was
initially postulated by Ludwig Boltzmann in the 1800s. For example, melting a block of ice means taking a highly
structured and orderly system of water molecules and converting it into a disorderly liquid in which molecules have
no fixed positions. (See Figure 15.35.) There is a large increase in entropy in the process, as seen in the following
example.


        EXAMPLE 15.8

Entropy Associated with Disorder
Find the increase in entropy of 1.00 kg of ice originally at        that is melted to form water at     .

Strategy

As before, the change in entropy can be calculated from the definition of          once we find the energy     needed to
melt the ice.

Solution

The change in entropy is defined as:

                                                                                                                    15.61

Here    is the heat transfer necessary to melt 1.00 kg of ice and is given by

                                                                                                                    15.62

where      is the mass and    is the latent heat of fusion.                    for water, so that

                                                                                                                    15.63

Now the change in entropy is positive, since heat transfer occurs into the ice to cause the phase change; thus,

                                                                                                                    15.64

  is the melting temperature of ice. That is,                      . So the change in entropy is

                                                               ×
                                                                                                                    15.65
                                                                ×
Discussion

This is a significant increase in entropy accompanying an increase in disorder.

      FIGURE 15.35 When ice melts, it becomes more disordered and less structured. The systematic arrangement of molecules in a crystal
      structure is replaced by a more random and less orderly movement of molecules without fixed locations or orientations. Its entropy
      increases because heat transfer occurs into it. Entropy is a measure of disorder.

      In another easily imagined example, suppose we mix equal masses of water originally at two different
      temperatures, say          and         . The result is water at an intermediate temperature of      . Three
      outcomes have resulted: entropy has increased, some energy has become unavailable to do work, and the system
      has become less orderly. Let us think about each of these results.

      First, entropy has increased for the same reason that it did in the example above. Mixing the two bodies of water has
      the same effect as heat transfer from the hot one and the same heat transfer into the cold one. The mixing
      decreases the entropy of the hot water but increases the entropy of the cold water by a greater amount, producing
      an overall increase in entropy.

      Second, once the two masses of water are mixed, there is only one temperature—you cannot run a heat engine with
      them. The energy that could have been used to run a heat engine is now unavailable to do work.

      Third, the mixture is less orderly, or to use another term, less structured. Rather than having two masses at different
      temperatures and with different distributions of molecular speeds, we now have a single mass with a uniform
      temperature.

      These three results—entropy, unavailability of energy, and disorder—are not only related but are in fact essentially
      equivalent.

      Life, Evolution, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics
      Some people misunderstand the second law of thermodynamics, stated in terms of entropy, to say that the process
      of the evolution of life violates this law. Over time, complex organisms evolved from much simpler ancestors,
      representing a large decrease in entropy of the Earth’s biosphere. It is a fact that living organisms have evolved to be
      highly structured, and much lower in entropy than the substances from which they grow. But it is always possible for
      the entropy of one part of the universe to decrease, provided the total change in entropy of the universe increases.
      In equation form, we can write this as

                                                                                                                                    15.66

      Thus           can be negative as long as               is positive and greater in magnitude.

      How is it possible for a system to decrease its entropy? Energy transfer is necessary. If I pick up marbles that are
      scattered about the room and put them into a cup, my work has decreased the entropy of that system. If I gather
      iron ore from the ground and convert it into steel and build a bridge, my work has decreased the entropy of that
      system. Energy coming from the Sun can decrease the entropy of local systems on Earth—that is,              is negative.
      But the overall entropy of the rest of the universe increases by a greater amount—that is,       is positive and
      greater in magnitude. Thus,                                   , and the second law of thermodynamics is not violated.

      Every time a plant stores some solar energy in the form of chemical potential energy, or an updraft of warm air lifts a
      soaring bird, the Earth can be viewed as a heat engine operating between a hot reservoir supplied by the Sun and a

cold reservoir supplied by dark outer space—a heat engine of high complexity, causing local decreases in entropy as
it uses part of the heat transfer from the Sun into deep space. There is a large total increase in entropy resulting
from this massive heat transfer. A small part of this heat transfer is stored in structured systems on Earth, producing
much smaller local decreases in entropy. (See Figure 15.36.)

forms.

Thermodynamics: The Underlying Explanation
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Identify probabilities in entropy.
 • Analyze statistical probabilities in entropic systems.




FIGURE 15.37 When you toss a coin a large number of times, heads and tails tend to come up in roughly equal numbers. Why doesn’t
heads come up 100, 90, or even 80% of the time? (credit: Jon Sullivan, PDPhoto.org)

The various ways of formulating the second law of thermodynamics tell what happens rather than why it happens.
662   15 • Thermodynamics



      Why should heat transfer occur only from hot to cold? Why should energy become ever less available to do work?
      Why should the universe become increasingly disorderly? The answer is that it is a matter of overwhelming
      probability. Disorder is simply vastly more likely than order.

      When you watch an emerging rain storm begin to wet the ground, you will notice that the drops fall in a disorganized
      manner both in time and in space. Some fall close together, some far apart, but they never fall in straight, orderly
      rows. It is not impossible for rain to fall in an orderly pattern, just highly unlikely, because there are many more
      disorderly ways than orderly ones. To illustrate this fact, we will examine some random processes, starting with coin
      tosses.

      Coin Tosses
      What are the possible outcomes of tossing 5 coins? Each coin can land either heads or tails. On the large scale, we
      are concerned only with the total heads and tails and not with the order in which heads and tails appear. The
      following possibilities exist:




                                                                                                                   15.67




      These are what we call macrostates. A macrostate is an overall property of a system. It does not specify the details
      of the system, such as the order in which heads and tails occur or which coins are heads or tails.

      Using this nomenclature, a system of 5 coins has the 6 possible macrostates just listed. Some macrostates are more
      likely to occur than others. For instance, there is only one way to get 5 heads, but there are several ways to get 3
      heads and 2 tails, making the latter macrostate more probable. Table 15.3 lists of all the ways in which 5 coins can
      be tossed, taking into account the order in which heads and tails occur. Each sequence is called a microstate—a
      detailed description of every element of a system.

TABLE 15.3 5-Coin Toss

The macrostate of 3 heads and 2 tails can be achieved in 10 ways and is thus 10 times more probable than the one
having 5 heads. Not surprisingly, it is equally probable to have the reverse, 2 heads and 3 tails. Similarly, it is equally
probable to get 5 tails as it is to get 5 heads. Note that all of these conclusions are based on the crucial assumption
that each microstate is equally probable. With coin tosses, this requires that the coins not be asymmetric in a way
that favors one side over the other, as with loaded dice. With any system, the assumption that all microstates are
equally probable must be valid, or the analysis will be erroneous.

The two most orderly possibilities are 5 heads or 5 tails. (They are more structured than the others.) They are also
the least likely, only 2 out of 32 possibilities. The most disorderly possibilities are 3 heads and 2 tails and its reverse.
(They are the least structured.) The most disorderly possibilities are also the most likely, with 20 out of 32
possibilities for the 3 heads and 2 tails and its reverse. If we start with an orderly array like 5 heads and toss the
coins, it is very likely that we will get a less orderly array as a result, since 30 out of the 32 possibilities are less
orderly. So even if you start with an orderly state, there is a strong tendency to go from order to disorder, from low
entropy to high entropy. The reverse can happen, but it is unlikely.

      This result becomes dramatic for larger systems. Consider what happens if you have 100 coins instead of just 5. The
      most orderly arrangements (most structured) are 100 heads or 100 tails. The least orderly (least structured) is that
      of 50 heads and 50 tails. There is only 1 way (1 microstate) to get the most orderly arrangement of 100 heads.
      There are 100 ways (100 microstates) to get the next most orderly arrangement of 99 heads and 1 tail (also 100 to
      get its reverse). And there are              ways to get 50 heads and 50 tails, the least orderly arrangement. Table
      15.4 is an abbreviated list of the various macrostates and the number of microstates for each macrostate. The total
      number of microstates—the total number of different ways 100 coins can be tossed—is an impressively large
                    . Now, if we start with an orderly macrostate like 100 heads and toss the coins, there is a virtual
      certainty that we will get a less orderly macrostate. If we keep tossing the coins, it is possible, but exceedingly
      unlikely, that we will ever get back to the most orderly macrostate. If you tossed the coins once each second, you
      could expect to get either 100 heads or 100 tails once in             years! This period is 1 trillion (   ) times longer
      than the age of the universe, and so the chances are essentially zero. In contrast, there is an 8% chance of getting
      50 heads, a 73% chance of getting from 45 to 55 heads, and a 96% chance of getting from 40 to 60 heads. Disorder
      is highly likely.

      Disorder in a Gas
      The fantastic growth in the odds favoring disorder that we see in going from 5 to 100 coins continues as the number
      of entities in the system increases. Let us now imagine applying this approach to perhaps a small sample of gas.
      Because counting microstates and macrostates involves statistics, this is called statistical analysis. The
      macrostates of a gas correspond to its macroscopic properties, such as volume, temperature, and pressure; and its
      microstates correspond to the detailed description of the positions and velocities of its atoms. Even a small amount
      of gas has a huge number of atoms:            of an ideal gas at 1.0 atm and     has              atoms. So each
      macrostate has an immense number of microstates. In plain language, this means that there are an immense
      number of ways in which the atoms in a gas can be arranged, while still having the same pressure, temperature, and
      so on.

      The most likely conditions (or macrostates) for a gas are those we see all the time—a random distribution of atoms
      in space with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of speeds in random directions, as predicted by kinetic theory. This

is the most disorderly and least structured condition we can imagine. In contrast, one type of very orderly and
structured macrostate has all of the atoms in one corner of a container with identical velocities. There are very few
ways to accomplish this (very few microstates corresponding to it), and so it is exceedingly unlikely ever to occur.
(See Figure 15.38(b).) Indeed, it is so unlikely that we have a law saying that it is impossible, which has never been
observed to be violated—the second law of thermodynamics.




FIGURE 15.38 (a) The ordinary state of gas in a container is a disorderly, random distribution of atoms or molecules with a Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution of speeds. It is so unlikely that these atoms or molecules would ever end up in one corner of the container that it
might as well be impossible. (b) With energy transfer, the gas can be forced into one corner and its entropy greatly reduced. But left alone, it
will spontaneously increase its entropy and return to the normal conditions, because they are immensely more likely.

The disordered condition is one of high entropy, and the ordered one has low entropy. With a transfer of energy from
another system, we could force all of the atoms into one corner and have a local decrease in entropy, but at the cost
of an overall increase in entropy of the universe. If the atoms start out in one corner, they will quickly disperse and
become uniformly distributed and will never return to the orderly original state (Figure 15.38(b)). Entropy will
increase. With such a large sample of atoms, it is possible—but unimaginably unlikely—for entropy to decrease.
Disorder is vastly more likely than order.

The arguments that disorder and high entropy are the most probable states are quite convincing. The great Austrian
physicist Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906)—who, along with Maxwell, made so many contributions to kinetic
theory—proved that the entropy of a system in a given state (a macrostate) can be written as
                                                                                                                                      15.68
where                          is Boltzmann’s constant, and          is the natural logarithm of the number of
microstates     corresponding to the given macrostate.        is proportional to the probability that the macrostate will
occur. Thus entropy is directly related to the probability of a state—the more likely the state, the greater its entropy.
Boltzmann proved that this expression for is equivalent to the definition                  , which we have used
extensively.

Thus the second law of thermodynamics is explained on a very basic level: entropy either remains the same or
increases in every process. This phenomenon is due to the extraordinarily small probability of a decrease, based on
the extraordinarily larger number of microstates in systems with greater entropy. Entropy can decrease, but for any
macroscopic system, this outcome is so unlikely that it will never be observed.

              EXAMPLE 15.9

      Entropy Increases in a Coin Toss
      Suppose you toss 100 coins starting with 60 heads and 40 tails, and you get the most likely result, 50 heads and 50
      tails. What is the change in entropy?

      Strategy

      Noting that the number of microstates is labeled    in Table 15.4 for the 100-coin toss, we can use
                                        to calculate the change in entropy.

      Solution

      The change in entropy is

                                                                                                                       15.69

      where the subscript i stands for the initial 60 heads and 40 tails state, and the subscript f for the final 50 heads and
      50 tails state. Substituting the values for    from Table 15.4 gives

                                                                                                                       15.70


      Discussion

      This increase in entropy means we have moved to a less orderly situation. It is not impossible for further tosses to
      produce the initial state of 60 heads and 40 tails, but it is less likely. There is about a 1 in 90 chance for that
      decrease in entropy (                     ) to occur. If we calculate the decrease in entropy to move to the most
      orderly state, we get                           . There is about a            chance of this change occurring. So while
      very small decreases in entropy are unlikely, slightly greater decreases are impossibly unlikely. These probabilities
      imply, again, that for a macroscopic system, a decrease in entropy is impossible. For example, for heat transfer to
      occur spontaneously from 1.00 kg of          ice to its     environment, there would be a decrease in entropy of
                       . Given that a                    corresponds to about a              chance, a decrease of this size
      (        ) is an utter impossibility. Even for a milligram of melted ice to spontaneously refreeze is impossible.



        Problem-Solving Strategies for Entropy
        1. Examine the situation to determine if entropy is involved.
        2. Identify the system of interest and draw a labeled diagram of the system showing energy flow.
        3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is
           useful.
        4. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). You must
           carefully identify the heat transfer, if any, and the temperature at which the process takes place. It is also
           important to identify the initial and final states.
        5. Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown). Note that the change in
           entropy can be determined between any states by calculating it for a reversible process.
        6. Substitute the known value along with their units into the appropriate equation, and obtain numerical
           solutions complete with units.
        7. To see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? For example, total entropy should increase for any real
           process or be constant for a reversible process. Disordered states should be more probable and have
           greater entropy than ordered states.

INTRODUCTION TO OSCILLATORY MOTION AND WAVES What do an ocean buoy, a child in a swing, the cone
inside a speaker, a guitar, atoms in a crystal, the motion of chest cavities, and the beating of hearts all have in
common? They all oscillate—-that is, they move back and forth between two points. Many systems oscillate, and
they have certain characteristics in common. All oscillations involve force and energy. You push a child in a swing to
get the motion started. The energy of atoms vibrating in a crystal can be increased with heat. You put energy into a
guitar string when you pluck it.

Some oscillations create waves. A guitar creates sound waves. You can make water waves in a swimming pool by
slapping the water with your hand. You can no doubt think of other types of waves. Some, such as water waves, are
678   16 • Oscillatory Motion and Waves



      visible. Some, such as sound waves, are not. But every wave is a disturbance that moves from its source and carries
      energy. Other examples of waves include earthquakes and visible light. Even subatomic particles, such as electrons,
      can behave like waves.

      By studying oscillatory motion and waves, we shall find that a small number of underlying principles describe all of
      them and that wave phenomena are more common than you have ever imagined. We begin by studying the type of
      force that underlies the simplest oscillations and waves. We will then expand our exploration of oscillatory motion
      and waves to include concepts such as simple harmonic motion, uniform circular motion, and damped harmonic
      motion. Finally, we will explore what happens when two or more waves share the same space, in the phenomena
      known as superposition and interference.

      16.1 Hooke’s Law: Stress and Strain Revisited
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Explain Newton’s third law of motion with respect to stress and deformation.
       • Describe the restoration of force and displacement.
       • Calculate the energy in Hooke’s Law of deformation, and the stored energy in a spring.




      FIGURE 16.2 When displaced from its vertical equilibrium position, this plastic ruler oscillates back and forth because of the restoring force
      opposing displacement. When the ruler is on the left, there is a force to the right, and vice versa.

      Newton’s first law implies that an object oscillating back and forth is experiencing forces. Without force, the object
      would move in a straight line at a constant speed rather than oscillate. Consider, for example, plucking a plastic ruler
      to the left as shown in Figure 16.2. The deformation of the ruler creates a force in the opposite direction, known as a
      restoring force. Once released, the restoring force causes the ruler to move back toward its stable equilibrium
      position, where the net force on it is zero. However, by the time the ruler gets there, it gains momentum and
      continues to move to the right, producing the opposite deformation. It is then forced to the left, back through
      equilibrium, and the process is repeated until dissipative forces dampen the motion. These forces remove
      mechanical energy from the system, gradually reducing the motion until the ruler comes to rest.

      The simplest oscillations occur when the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement. When stress and
      strain were covered in Newton’s Third Law of Motion, the name was given to this relationship between force and
      displacement was Hooke’s law:
                                                                                                                                            16.1
      Here, is the restoring force, is the displacement from equilibrium or deformation, and is a constant related to
      the difficulty in deforming the system. The minus sign indicates the restoring force is in the direction opposite to the
      displacement.

FIGURE 16.3 (a) The plastic ruler has been released, and the restoring force is returning the ruler to its equilibrium position. (b) The net
force is zero at the equilibrium position, but the ruler has momentum and continues to move to the right. (c) The restoring force is in the
opposite direction. It stops the ruler and moves it back toward equilibrium again. (d) Now the ruler has momentum to the left. (e) In the
absence of damping (caused by frictional forces), the ruler reaches its original position. From there, the motion will repeat itself.

The force constant is related to the rigidity (or stiffness) of a system—the larger the force constant, the greater the
restoring force, and the stiffer the system. The units of are newtons per meter (N/m). For example, is directly
related to Young’s modulus when we stretch a string. Figure 16.4 shows a graph of the absolute value of the
restoring force versus the displacement for a system that can be described by Hooke’s law—a simple spring in this
case. The slope of the graph equals the force constant in newtons per meter. A common physics laboratory
exercise is to measure restoring forces created by springs, determine if they follow Hooke’s law, and calculate their
force constants if they do.




FIGURE 16.4 (a) A graph of absolute value of the restoring force versus displacement is displayed. The fact that the graph is a straight line
means that the system obeys Hooke’s law. The slope of the graph is the force constant . (b) The data in the graph were generated by
measuring the displacement of a spring from equilibrium while supporting various weights. The restoring force equals the weight
supported, if the mass is stationary.

      How Stiff Are Car Springs?




      FIGURE 16.5 The mass of a car increases due to the introduction of a passenger. This affects the displacement of the car on its suspension
      system. (credit: exfordy on Flickr)

      What is the force constant for the suspension system of a car that settles 1.20 cm when an 80.0-kg person gets in?

      Strategy

      Consider the car to be in its equilibrium position               before the person gets in. The car then settles down 1.20 cm,
      which means it is displaced to a position                                . At that point, the springs supply a restoring force
      equal to the person’s weight                                                      . We take this force to be in Hooke’s law.
      Knowing      and , we can then solve the force constant .

      Solution

      1. Solve Hooke’s law,                  , for :
                                                                                                                                         16.2

           Substitute known values and solve :


                                                                                                                                         16.3


      Discussion

      Note that and have opposite signs because they are in opposite directions—the restoring force is up, and the
      displacement is down. Also, note that the car would oscillate up and down when the person got in if it were not for
      damping (due to frictional forces) provided by shock absorbers. Bouncing cars are a sure sign of bad shock
      absorbers.


      Energy in Hooke’s Law of Deformation
      In order to produce a deformation, work must be done. That is, a force must be exerted through a distance, whether
      you pluck a guitar string or compress a car spring. If the only result is deformation, and no work goes into thermal,
      sound, or kinetic energy, then all the work is initially stored in the deformed object as some form of potential energy.
      The potential energy stored in a spring is                  . Here, we generalize the idea to elastic potential energy for a
      deformation of any system that can be described by Hooke’s law. Hence,

                                                                                                                                       16.4

where     is the elastic potential energy stored in any deformed system that obeys Hooke’s law and has a
displacement from equilibrium and a force constant .

It is possible to find the work done in deforming a system in order to find the energy stored. This work is performed
by an applied force        . The applied force is exactly opposite to the restoring force (action-reaction), and so
             . Figure 16.6 shows a graph of the applied force versus deformation                   for a system that can be described
by Hooke’s law. Work done on the system is force multiplied by distance, which equals the area under the curve or
          (Method A in the figure). Another way to determine the work is to note that the force increases linearly
from 0 to    , so that the average force is        , the distance moved is , and thus
                                          (Method B in the figure).




FIGURE 16.6 A graph of applied force versus distance for the deformation of a system that can be described by Hooke’s law is displayed.
The work done on the system equals the area under the graph or the area of the triangle, which is half its base multiplied by its height, or
             .


        EXAMPLE 16.2

Calculating Stored Energy: A Toy Gun Spring
We can use a toy gun’s spring mechanism to ask and answer two simple questions: (a) How much energy is stored in
the spring of a toy gun that has a force constant of 50.0 N/m and is compressed 0.150 m? (b) If you neglect friction
and the mass of the spring, at what speed will a 2.00-g projectile be ejected from the gun?




FIGURE 16.7 (a) In this image of the gun, the spring is uncompressed before being cocked. (b) The spring has been compressed a distance
682   16 • Oscillatory Motion and Waves



       , and the projectile is in place. (c) When released, the spring converts elastic potential energy   into kinetic energy.

      Strategy for a

      (a): The energy stored in the spring can be found directly from elastic potential energy equation, because                  and
      are given.

      Solution for a

      Entering the given values for         and     yields


                                                                                                                                    16.5


      Strategy for b

      Because there is no friction, the potential energy is converted entirely into kinetic energy. The expression for kinetic
      energy can be solved for the projectile’s speed.

      Solution for b

      1. Identify known quantities:
                                                                                                                                    16.6

      2. Solve for :

                                                                                                                                    16.7


      3. Convert units:

      Discussion

      (a) and (b): This projectile speed is impressive for a toy gun (more than 80 km/h). The numbers in this problem seem
      reasonable. The force needed to compress the spring is small enough for an adult to manage, and the energy
      imparted to the dart is small enough to limit the damage it might do, especially because the darts in many of these
      guns are made of soft material with a rubber tip. Yet, the speed of the dart is great enough for it to travel an
      acceptable distance.

When you pluck a guitar string, the resulting sound has a steady tone and lasts a long time. Each successive
vibration of the string takes the same time as the previous one. We define periodic motion to be a motion that
repeats itself at regular time intervals, such as exhibited by the guitar string or by an object on a spring moving up
and down. The time to complete one oscillation remains constant and is called the period . Its units are usually
seconds, but may be any convenient unit of time. The word period refers to the time for some event whether
repetitive or not; but we shall be primarily interested in periodic motion, which is by definition repetitive. A concept
closely related to period is the frequency of an event. For example, if you get a paycheck twice a month, the
frequency of payment is two per month and the period between checks is half a month. Frequency is defined to
be the number of events per unit time. For periodic motion, frequency is the number of oscillations per unit time.
The relationship between frequency and period is

                                                                                                                                16.8

The SI unit for frequency is the cycle per second, which is defined to be a hertz (Hz):

                                                                                                                                16.9

A cycle is one complete oscillation. Note that a vibration can be a single or multiple event, whereas oscillations are
usually repetitive for a significant number of cycles.

      16.3 Simple Harmonic Motion: A Special Periodic Motion
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Describe a simple harmonic oscillator.
       • Explain the link between simple harmonic motion and waves.

      The oscillations of a system in which the net force can be described by Hooke’s law are of special importance,
      because they are very common. They are also the simplest oscillatory systems. Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is
      the name given to oscillatory motion for a system where the net force can be described by Hooke’s law, and such a
      system is called a simple harmonic oscillator. If the net force can be described by Hooke’s law and there is no
      damping (by friction or other non-conservative forces), then a simple harmonic oscillator will oscillate with equal
      displacement on either side of the equilibrium position, as shown for an object on a spring in Figure 16.9. The
      maximum displacement from equilibrium is called the amplitude . The units for amplitude and displacement are
      the same, but depend on the type of oscillation. For the object on the spring, the units of amplitude and
      displacement are meters; whereas for sound oscillations, they have units of pressure (and other types of oscillations
      have yet other units). Because amplitude is the maximum displacement, it is related to the energy in the oscillation.


        Take-Home Experiment: SHM and the Marble
        Find a bowl or basin that is shaped like a hemisphere on the inside. Place a marble inside the bowl and tilt the
        bowl periodically so the marble rolls from the bottom of the bowl to equally high points on the sides of the bowl.

  Get a feel for the force required to maintain this periodic motion. What is the restoring force and what role does
  the force you apply play in the simple harmonic motion (SHM) of the marble?




FIGURE 16.9 An object attached to a spring sliding on a frictionless surface is an uncomplicated simple harmonic oscillator. When
displaced from equilibrium, the object performs simple harmonic motion that has an amplitude and a period . The object’s maximum
speed occurs as it passes through equilibrium. The stiffer the spring is, the smaller the period . The greater the mass of the object is, the
greater the period .

What is so significant about simple harmonic motion? One special thing is that the period and frequency of a
simple harmonic oscillator are independent of amplitude. The string of a guitar, for example, will oscillate with the
same frequency whether plucked gently or hard. Because the period is constant, a simple harmonic oscillator can be
used as a clock.

Two important factors do affect the period of a simple harmonic oscillator. The period is related to how stiff the
system is. A very stiff object has a large force constant , which causes the system to have a smaller period. For
example, you can adjust a diving board’s stiffness—the stiffer it is, the faster it vibrates, and the shorter its period.
Period also depends on the mass of the oscillating system. The more massive the system is, the longer the period.
For example, a heavy person on a diving board bounces up and down more slowly than a light one.

In fact, the mass and the force constant              are the only factors that affect the period and frequency of simple
harmonic motion.


  Period of Simple Harmonic Oscillator
  The period of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by

                                                                                                                                   16.15

  and, because               , the frequency of a simple harmonic oscillator is

                                                                                                                                   16.16

  Note that neither       nor     has any dependence on amplitude.

        Take-Home Experiment: Mass and Ruler Oscillations
        Find two identical wooden or plastic rulers. Tape one end of each ruler firmly to the edge of a table so that the
        length of each ruler that protrudes from the table is the same. On the free end of one ruler tape a heavy object
        such as a few large coins. Pluck the ends of the rulers at the same time and observe which one undergoes more
        cycles in a time period, and measure the period of oscillation of each of the rulers.



              EXAMPLE 16.4

      Calculate the Frequency and Period of Oscillations: Bad Shock Absorbers in a Car
      If the shock absorbers in a car go bad, then the car will oscillate at the least provocation, such as when going over
      bumps in the road and after stopping (See Figure 16.10). Calculate the frequency and period of these oscillations for
      such a car if the car’s mass (including its load) is 900 kg and the force constant ( ) of the suspension system is
                        .

      Strategy

      The frequency of the car’s oscillations will be that of a simple harmonic oscillator as given in the equation
                     . The mass and the force constant are both given.

      Solution

      2. Calculate the frequency:
                                                                                                                                    16.18

      3. You could use                     to calculate the period, but it is simpler to use the relationship                 and
           substitute the value just found for :

                                                                                                                                    16.19

      Discussion

      The values of and both seem about right for a bouncing car. You can observe these oscillations if you push down
      hard on the end of a car and let go.


      The Link between Simple Harmonic Motion and Waves
      If a time-exposure photograph of the bouncing car were taken as it drove by, the headlight would make a wavelike
      streak, as shown in Figure 16.10. Similarly, Figure 16.11 shows an object bouncing on a spring as it leaves a
      wavelike "trace" of its position on a moving strip of paper. Both waves are sine functions. All simple harmonic motion
      is intimately related to sine and cosine waves.




      FIGURE 16.10 The bouncing car makes a wavelike motion. If the restoring force in the suspension system can be described only by Hooke’s
      law, then the wave is a sine function. (The wave is the trace produced by the headlight as the car moves to the right.)

The displacement as a function of time t in any simple harmonic motion—that is, one in which the net restoring force

                                                                                                                                  16.20

period . (When        , we get          again because                       .). Furthermore, from this expression for , the
velocity as a function of time is given by:

                                                                                                                                  16.21


where                                 . The object has zero velocity at maximum displacement—for example,
when        , and at that time          . The minus sign in the first equation for    gives the correct direction for the
velocity. Just after the start of the motion, for instance, the velocity is negative because the system is moving back
toward the equilibrium point. Finally, we can get an expression for acceleration using Newton’s second law. [Then
we have                and      , the quantities needed for kinematics and a description of simple harmonic motion.]
According to Newton’s second law, the acceleration is                         . So,    is also a cosine function:

                                                                                                                                  16.22

Hence,       is directly proportional to and in the opposite direction to              .

      Hooke’s law, and so the object undergoes simple harmonic motion. Note that the initial position has the vertical displacement at its
      maximum value ; is initially zero and then negative as the object moves down; and the initial acceleration is negative, back toward the
      equilibrium position and becomes zero at that point.

      The most important point here is that these equations are mathematically straightforward and are valid for all
      simple harmonic motion. They are very useful in visualizing waves associated with simple harmonic motion,

16.4 The Simple Pendulum
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Measure acceleration due to gravity.




FIGURE 16.13 A simple pendulum has a small-diameter bob and a string that has a very small mass but is strong enough not to stretch
appreciably. The linear displacement from equilibrium is , the length of the arc. Also shown are the forces on the bob, which result in a net
force of           toward the equilibrium position—that is, a restoring force.

Pendulums are in common usage. Some have crucial uses, such as in clocks; some are for fun, such as a child’s
swing; and some are just there, such as the sinker on a fishing line. For small displacements, a pendulum is a simple
harmonic oscillator. A simple pendulum is defined to have an object that has a small mass, also known as the
pendulum bob, which is suspended from a light wire or string, such as shown in Figure 16.13. Exploring the simple
pendulum a bit further, we can discover the conditions under which it performs simple harmonic motion, and we can
derive an interesting expression for its period.

We begin by defining the displacement to be the arc length . We see from Figure 16.13 that the net force on the
bob is tangent to the arc and equals              . (The weight    has components        along the string and
          tangent to the arc.) Tension in the string exactly cancels the component        parallel to the string.
This leaves a net restoring force back toward the equilibrium position at      .

Now, if we can show that the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement, then we have a simple
harmonic oscillator. In trying to determine if we have a simple harmonic oscillator, we should note that for small
angles (less than about      ),          (      and differ by about 1% or less at smaller angles). Thus, for angles
less than about     , the restoring force is
                                                                                                                                    16.23
The displacement is directly proportional to . When                 is expressed in radians, the arc length in a circle is related
to its radius ( in this instance) by:

      so that

                                                                                                                          16.25

      For small angles, then, the expression for the restoring force is:

                                                                                                                          16.26

      This expression is of the form:
                                                                                                                          16.27
      where the force constant is given by               and the displacement is given by      . For angles less than about
         , the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement, and the simple pendulum is a simple harmonic
      oscillator.

      Using this equation, we can find the period of a pendulum for amplitudes less than about         . For the simple

      for the period of a simple pendulum. This result is interesting because of its simplicity. The only things that affect
      the period of a simple pendulum are its length and the acceleration due to gravity. The period is completely
      independent of other factors, such as mass. As with simple harmonic oscillators, the period for a pendulum is
      nearly independent of amplitude, especially if is less than about      . Even simple pendulum clocks can be finely
      adjusted and accurate.

      Note the dependence of on . If the length of a pendulum is precisely known, it can actually be used to measure
      the acceleration due to gravity. Consider the following example.

Discussion

This method for determining can be very accurate. This is why length and period are given to five digits in this
example. For the precision of the approximation         to be better than the precision of the pendulum length
and period, the maximum displacement angle should be kept below about        .



 Making Career Connections

 aids the study of plate tectonics and helps in the search for oil fields and large mineral deposits.



 Take Home Experiment: Determining
 Use a simple pendulum to determine the acceleration due to gravity in your own locale. Cut a piece of a string
 or dental floss so that it is about 1 m long. Attach a small object of high density to the end of the string (for
 example, a metal nut or a car key). Starting at an angle of less than      , allow the pendulum to swing and
 measure the pendulum’s period for 10 oscillations using a stopwatch. Calculate . How accurate is this
 measurement? How might it be improved?


    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
An engineer builds two simple pendula. Both are suspended from small wires secured to the ceiling of a room. Each
pendulum hovers 2 cm above the floor. Pendulum 1 has a bob with a mass of            . Pendulum 2 has a bob with a
mass of        . Describe how the motion of the pendula will differ if the bobs are both displaced by    .
Solution
The movement of the pendula will not differ at all because the mass of the bob has no effect on the motion of a
simple pendulum. The pendula are only affected by the period (which is related to the pendulum’s length) and by
the acceleration due to gravity.

16.5 Energy and the Simple Harmonic Oscillator
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Determine the maximum speed of an oscillating system.

To study the energy of a simple harmonic oscillator, we first consider all the forms of energy it can have We know
from Hooke’s Law: Stress and Strain Revisited that the energy stored in the deformation of a simple harmonic
oscillator is a form of potential energy given by:
692   16 • Oscillatory Motion and Waves




                                                                                                                                         16.33

      Because a simple harmonic oscillator has no dissipative forces, the other important form of energy is kinetic energy
         . Conservation of energy for these two forms is:
                                                                                                                                         16.34
      or

                                                                                                                                         16.35

      This statement of conservation of energy is valid for all simple harmonic oscillators, including ones where the
      gravitational force plays a role

      Namely, for a simple pendulum we replace the velocity with                        , the spring constant with                 , and the
      displacement term with        . Thus

                                                                                                                                         16.36

      In the case of undamped simple harmonic motion, the energy oscillates back and forth between kinetic and
      potential, going completely from one to the other as the system oscillates. So for the simple example of an object on
      a frictionless surface attached to a spring, as shown again in Figure 16.14, the motion starts with all of the energy
      stored in the spring. As the object starts to move, the elastic potential energy is converted to kinetic energy,
      becoming entirely kinetic energy at the equilibrium position. It is then converted back into elastic potential energy
      by the spring, the velocity becomes zero when the kinetic energy is completely converted, and so on. This concept
      provides extra insight here and in later applications of simple harmonic motion, such as alternating current circuits.




      FIGURE 16.14 The transformation of energy in simple harmonic motion is illustrated for an object attached to a spring on a frictionless
      surface.

      The conservation of energy principle can be used to derive an expression for velocity . If we start our simple
      harmonic motion with zero velocity and maximum displacement (          ), then the total energy is

                                                                                                                                         16.37

      This total energy is constant and is shifted back and forth between kinetic energy and potential energy, at most

times being shared by each. The conservation of energy for this system in equation form is thus:

                                                                                                                 16.38

Solving this equation for   yields:

                                                                                                                 16.39

Manipulating this expression algebraically gives:


                                                                                                                 16.40


and so


                                                                                                                 16.41


where

                                                                                                                 16.42

From this expression, we see that the velocity is a maximum (    ) at      , as stated earlier in
                     . Notice that the maximum velocity depends on three factors. Maximum velocity is directly
proportional to amplitude. As you might guess, the greater the maximum displacement the greater the maximum
velocity. Maximum velocity is also greater for stiffer systems, because they exert greater force for the same
displacement. This observation is seen in the expression for         it is proportional to the square root of the force
constant . Finally, the maximum velocity is smaller for objects that have larger masses, because the maximum
velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of . For a given force, objects that have large masses accelerate
more slowly.

A similar calculation for the simple pendulum produces a similar result, namely:

                                                                                                                 16.43

      Discussion

      This answer seems reasonable for a bouncing car. There are other ways to use conservation of energy to find               .
      We could use it directly, as was done in the example featured in Hooke’s Law: Stress and Strain Revisited.

      The small vertical displacement         of an oscillating simple pendulum, starting from its equilibrium position, is given
      as
                                                                                                                           16.45

      where    is the amplitude,        is the angular velocity and is the time taken. Substituting         , we have


                                                                                                                           16.46

      Thus, the displacement of pendulum is a function of time as shown above.

      Also the velocity of the pendulum is given by

                                                                                                                           16.47

      so the motion of the pendulum is a function of time.

      Why does it hurt more if your hand is snapped with a ruler than with a loose spring, even if the displacement of each
      system is equal?
      Solution
      The ruler is a stiffer system, which carries greater force for the same amount of displacement. The ruler snaps your
      hand with greater force, which hurts more.

      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Compare simple harmonic motion with uniform circular motion.

              FIGURE 16.15 The horses on this merry-go-round exhibit uniform circular motion. (credit: Wonderlane, Flickr)

There is an easy way to produce simple harmonic motion by using uniform circular motion. Figure 16.16 shows one
way of using this method. A ball is attached to a uniformly rotating vertical turntable, and its shadow is projected on
the floor as shown. The shadow undergoes simple harmonic motion. Hooke’s law usually describes uniform circular
motions ( constant) rather than systems that have large visible displacements. So observing the projection of
uniform circular motion, as in Figure 16.16, is often easier than observing a precise large-scale simple harmonic
oscillator. If studied in sufficient depth, simple harmonic motion produced in this manner can give considerable
insight into many aspects of oscillations and waves and is very useful mathematically. In our brief treatment, we
shall indicate some of the major features of this relationship and how they might be useful.




FIGURE 16.16 The shadow of a ball rotating at constant angular velocity   on a turntable goes back and forth in precise simple harmonic
motion.

Figure 16.17 shows the basic relationship between uniform circular motion and simple harmonic motion. The point
P travels around the circle at constant angular velocity . The point P is analogous to an object on the merry-go-
round. The projection of the position of P onto a fixed axis undergoes simple harmonic motion and is analogous to
the shadow of the object. At the time shown in the figure, the projection has position and moves to the left with
velocity . The velocity of the point P around the circle equals      .The projection of      on the -axis is the
velocity of the simple harmonic motion along the -axis.

      FIGURE 16.17 A point P moving on a circular path with a constant angular velocity is undergoing uniform circular motion. Its projection
      on the x-axis undergoes simple harmonic motion. Also shown is the velocity of this point around the circle,  , and its projection, which
      is . Note that these velocities form a similar triangle to the displacement triangle.

      To see that the projection undergoes simple harmonic motion, note that its position                  is given by
                                                                                                                                       16.48
      where           ,   is the constant angular velocity, and         is the radius of the circular path. Thus,
                                                                                                                                       16.49
      The angular velocity is in radians per unit time; in this case  radians is the time for one revolution                    . That is,
               . Substituting this expression for , we see that the position is given by:

                                                                                                                                       16.50

      This expression is the same one we had for the position of a simple harmonic oscillator in Simple Harmonic Motion:
      A Special Periodic Motion. If we make a graph of position versus time as in Figure 16.18, we see again the wavelike
      character (typical of simple harmonic motion) of the projection of uniform circular motion onto the -axis.




      FIGURE 16.18 The position of the projection of uniform circular motion performs simple harmonic motion, as this wavelike graph of
      versus indicates.

      Now let us use Figure 16.17 to do some further analysis of uniform circular motion as it relates to simple harmonic
      motion. The triangle formed by the velocities in the figure and the triangle formed by the displacements (      and
                   ) are similar right triangles. Taking ratios of similar sides, we see that

                                                                                                                16.51


We can solve this equation for the speed    or


                                                                                                                16.52


This expression for the speed of a simple harmonic oscillator is exactly the same as the equation obtained from
conservation of energy considerations in Energy and the Simple Harmonic Oscillator.You can begin to see that it is
possible to get all of the characteristics of simple harmonic motion from an analysis of the projection of uniform
circular motion.

Finally, let us consider the period of the motion of the projection. This period is the time it takes the point P to
complete one revolution. That time is the circumference of the circle       divided by the velocity around the circle,
     . Thus, the period is

                                                                                                                16.53

We know from conservation of energy considerations that

                                                                                                                16.54

Solving this equation for         gives

                                                                                                                16.55

Substituting this expression into the equation for   yields

                                                                                                                16.56

Thus, the period of the motion is the same as for a simple harmonic oscillator. We have determined the period for
any simple harmonic oscillator using the relationship between uniform circular motion and simple harmonic motion.

Some modules occasionally refer to the connection between uniform circular motion and simple harmonic motion.
Moreover, if you carry your study of physics and its applications to greater depths, you will find this relationship
useful. It can, for example, help to analyze how waves add when they are superimposed.

      A guitar string stops oscillating a few seconds after being plucked. To keep a child happy on a swing, you must keep
      pushing. Although we can often make friction and other non-conservative forces negligibly small, completely
      undamped motion is rare. In fact, we may even want to damp oscillations, such as with car shock absorbers.

      For a system that has a small amount of damping, the period and frequency are nearly the same as for simple
      harmonic motion, but the amplitude gradually decreases as shown in Figure 16.20. This occurs because the non-
      conservative damping force removes energy from the system, usually in the form of thermal energy. In general,
      energy removal by non-conservative forces is described as
                                                                                                                                      16.57
      where      is work done by a non-conservative force (here the damping force). For a damped harmonic oscillator,
          is negative because it removes mechanical energy (KE + PE) from the system.




      FIGURE 16.20 In this graph of displacement versus time for a harmonic oscillator with a small amount of damping, the amplitude slowly
      decreases, but the period and frequency are nearly the same as if the system were completely undamped.

      If you gradually increase the amount of damping in a system, the period and frequency begin to be affected,
      because damping opposes and hence slows the back and forth motion. (The net force is smaller in both directions.)
      If there is very large damping, the system does not even oscillate—it slowly moves toward equilibrium. Figure 16.21
      shows the displacement of a harmonic oscillator for different amounts of damping. When we want to damp out
      oscillations, such as in the suspension of a car, we may want the system to return to equilibrium as quickly as
      possible Critical damping is defined as the condition in which the damping of an oscillator results in it returning as
      quickly as possible to its equilibrium position The critically damped system may overshoot the equilibrium position,
      but if it does, it will do so only once. Critical damping is represented by Curve A in Figure 16.21. With less-than
      critical damping, the system will return to equilibrium faster but will overshoot and cross over one or more times.
      Such a system is underdamped; its displacement is represented by the curve in Figure 16.20. Curve B in Figure
      16.21 represents an overdamped system. As with critical damping, it too may overshoot the equilibrium position,
      but will reach equilibrium over a longer period of time.

FIGURE 16.21 Displacement versus time for a critically damped harmonic oscillator (A) and an overdamped harmonic oscillator (B). The
critically damped oscillator returns to equilibrium at    in the smallest time possible without overshooting.

Critical damping is often desired, because such a system returns to equilibrium rapidly and remains at equilibrium
as well. In addition, a constant force applied to a critically damped system moves the system to a new equilibrium
position in the shortest time possible without overshooting or oscillating about the new position. For example, when
you stand on bathroom scales that have a needle gauge, the needle moves to its equilibrium position without
oscillating. It would be quite inconvenient if the needle oscillated about the new equilibrium position for a long time
before settling. Damping forces can vary greatly in character. Friction, for example, is sometimes independent of
velocity (as assumed in most places in this text). But many damping forces depend on velocity—sometimes in
complex ways, sometimes simply being proportional to velocity.


        EXAMPLE 16.7

Damping an Oscillatory Motion: Friction on an Object Connected to a Spring
Damping oscillatory motion is important in many systems, and the ability to control the damping is even more so.
This is generally attained using non-conservative forces such as the friction between surfaces, and viscosity for
objects moving through fluids. The following example considers friction. Suppose a 0.200-kg object is connected to
a spring as shown in Figure 16.22, but there is simple friction between the object and the surface, and the
coefficient of friction    is equal to 0.0800. (a) What is the frictional force between the surfaces? (b) What total
distance does the object travel if it is released 0.100 m from equilibrium, starting at       ? The force constant of the
spring is                .

surface.

      Strategy

      This problem requires you to integrate your knowledge of various concepts regarding waves, oscillations, and
      damping. To solve an integrated concept problem, you must first identify the physical principles involved. Part (a) is
      about the frictional force. This is a topic involving the application of Newton’s Laws. Part (b) requires an
      understanding of work and conservation of energy, as well as some understanding of horizontal oscillatory systems.

      Now that we have identified the principles we must apply in order to solve the problems, we need to identify the
      knowns and unknowns for each part of the question, as well as the quantity that is constant in Part (a) and Part (b)
      of the question.

      Solution a

      1. Choose the proper equation: Friction is             .
      2. Identify the known values.
      3. Enter the known values into the equation:
                                                                                                                     16.58

      4. Calculate and convert units:

      Discussion a

      The force here is small because the system and the coefficients are small.

      Solution b

      Identify the known:

       • The system involves elastic potential energy as the spring compresses and expands, friction that is related to
         the work done, and the kinetic energy as the body speeds up and slows down.
       • Energy is not conserved as the mass oscillates because friction is a non-conservative force.
       • The motion is horizontal, so gravitational potential energy does not need to be considered.
       • Because the motion starts from rest, the energy in the system is initially                   . This energy is
         removed by work done by friction               , where is the total distance traveled and              is the force
         of friction. When the system stops moving, the friction force will balance the force exerted by the spring, so
                             where is the final position and is given by


                                                                                                                     16.59


      1. By equating the work done to the energy removed, solve for the distance .
      2. The work done by the non-conservative forces equals the initial, stored elastic potential energy. Identify the
         correct equation to use:

                                                                                                                     16.60

      3. Recall that                .
      4. Enter the friction as              into           , thus
                                                                                                                     16.61
      5. Combine these two equations to find

                                                                                                                     16.62

      6. Solve the equation for         :

      7. Enter the known values into the resulting equation:

Discussion b

This is the total distance traveled back and forth across         , which is the undamped equilibrium position. The
number of oscillations about the equilibrium position will be more than                                        because
the amplitude of the oscillations is decreasing with time. At the end of the motion, this system will not return to
       for this type of damping force, because static friction will exceed the restoring force. This system is
underdamped. In contrast, an overdamped system with a simple constant damping force would not cross the
equilibrium position         a single time. For example, if this system had a damping force 20 times greater, it would
only move 0.0484 m toward the equilibrium position from its original 0.100-m position.

This worked example illustrates how to apply problem-solving strategies to situations that integrate the different
concepts you have learned. The first step is to identify the physical principles involved in the problem. The second
step is to solve for the unknowns using familiar problem-solving strategies. These are found throughout the text,
and many worked examples show how to use them for single topics. In this integrated concepts example, you can
see how to apply them across several topics. You will find these techniques useful in applications of physics outside
a physics course, such as in your profession, in other science disciplines, and in everyday life.


    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Why are completely undamped harmonic oscillators so rare?
Solution
Friction often comes into play whenever an object is moving. Friction causes damping in a harmonic oscillator.


    CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Describe the difference between overdamping, underdamping, and critical damping.
Solution
An overdamped system moves slowly toward equilibrium. An underdamped system moves quickly to equilibrium,
but will oscillate about the equilibrium point as it does so. A critically damped system moves as quickly as possible
toward equilibrium without oscillating about the equilibrium.


16.8 Forced Oscillations and Resonance
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Observe resonance of a paddle ball on a string.
 • Observe amplitude of a damped harmonic oscillator.
702   16 • Oscillatory Motion and Waves




      FIGURE 16.23 You can cause the strings in a piano to vibrate simply by producing sound waves from your voice. (credit: Matt Billings,
      Flickr)

      Sit in front of a piano sometime and sing a loud brief note at it with the dampers off its strings. It will sing the same
      note back at you—the strings, having the same frequencies as your voice, are resonating in response to the forces
      from the sound waves that you sent to them. Your voice and a piano’s strings is a good example of the fact that
      objects—in this case, piano strings—can be forced to oscillate but oscillate best at their natural frequency. In this
      section, we shall briefly explore applying a periodic driving force acting on a simple harmonic oscillator. The driving
      force puts energy into the system at a certain frequency, not necessarily the same as the natural frequency of the
      system. The natural frequency is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if there were no driving and no
      damping force.

      Most of us have played with toys involving an object supported on an elastic band, something like the paddle ball
      suspended from a finger in Figure 16.24. Imagine the finger in the figure is your finger. At first you hold your finger
      steady, and the ball bounces up and down with a small amount of damping. If you move your finger up and down
      slowly, the ball will follow along without bouncing much on its own. As you increase the frequency at which you
      move your finger up and down, the ball will respond by oscillating with increasing amplitude. When you drive the ball
      at its natural frequency, the ball’s oscillations increase in amplitude with each oscillation for as long as you drive it.
      The phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called resonance. A system
      being driven at its natural frequency is said to resonate. As the driving frequency gets progressively higher than the
      resonant or natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller, until the oscillations nearly
      disappear and your finger simply moves up and down with little effect on the ball.




      FIGURE 16.24 The paddle ball on its rubber band moves in response to the finger supporting it. If the finger moves with the natural
      frequency     of the ball on the rubber band, then a resonance is achieved, and the amplitude of the ball’s oscillations increases
      dramatically. At higher and lower driving frequencies, energy is transferred to the ball less efficiently, and it responds with lower-amplitude
      oscillations.

      Figure 16.25 shows a graph of the amplitude of a damped harmonic oscillator as a function of the frequency of the
      periodic force driving it. There are three curves on the graph, each representing a different amount of damping. All
      three curves peak at the point where the frequency of the driving force equals the natural frequency of the harmonic
      oscillator. The highest peak, or greatest response, is for the least amount of damping, because less energy is

removed by the damping force.




FIGURE 16.25 Amplitude of a harmonic oscillator as a function of the frequency of the driving force. The curves represent the same
oscillator with the same natural frequency but with different amounts of damping. Resonance occurs when the driving frequency equals the
natural frequency, and the greatest response is for the least amount of damping. The narrowest response is also for the least damping.

It is interesting that the widths of the resonance curves shown in Figure 16.25 depend on damping: the less the
damping, the narrower the resonance. The message is that if you want a driven oscillator to resonate at a very
specific frequency, you need as little damping as possible. Little damping is the case for piano strings and many
other musical instruments. Conversely, if you want small-amplitude oscillations, such as in a car’s suspension
system, then you want heavy damping. Heavy damping reduces the amplitude, but the tradeoff is that the system
responds at more frequencies.

These features of driven harmonic oscillators apply to a huge variety of systems. When you tune a radio, for
example, you are adjusting its resonant frequency so that it only oscillates to the desired station’s broadcast
(driving) frequency. The more selective the radio is in discriminating between stations, the smaller its damping.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen
nuclei) are made to resonate by incoming radio waves (on the order of 100 MHz). A child on a swing is driven by a
parent at the swing’s natural frequency to achieve maximum amplitude. In all of these cases, the efficiency of
energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance. Speed bumps and gravel roads prove
that even a car’s suspension system is not immune to resonance. In spite of finely engineered shock absorbers,
which ordinarily convert mechanical energy to thermal energy almost as fast as it comes in, speed bumps still cause
a large-amplitude oscillation. On gravel roads that are corrugated, you may have noticed that if you travel at the
“wrong” speed, the bumps are very noticeable whereas at other speeds you may hardly feel the bumps at all. Figure
16.26 shows a photograph of a famous example (the Tacoma Narrows Bridge) of the destructive effects of a driven
harmonic oscillation. The Millennium Bridge in London was closed for a short period of time for the same reason
while inspections were carried out.

In our bodies, the chest cavity is a clear example of a system at resonance. The diaphragm and chest wall drive the
oscillations of the chest cavity which result in the lungs inflating and deflating. The system is critically damped and
the muscular diaphragm oscillates at the resonant value for the system, making it highly efficient.

      FIGURE 16.26 In 1940, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington state collapsed. Heavy cross winds drove the bridge into oscillations at
      its resonant frequency. Damping decreased when support cables broke loose and started to slip over the towers, allowing increasingly
      greater amplitudes until the structure failed (credit: PRI's Studio 360, via Flickr)

           CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
      A famous magic trick involves a performer singing a note toward a crystal glass until the glass shatters. Explain why
      the trick works in terms of resonance and natural frequency.
      Solution
      The performer must be singing a note that corresponds to the natural frequency of the glass. As the sound wave is
      directed at the glass, the glass responds by resonating at the same frequency as the sound wave. With enough
      energy introduced into the system, the glass begins to vibrate and eventually shatters.


      16.9 Waves
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • State the characteristics of a wave.
       • Calculate the velocity of wave propagation.




                    FIGURE 16.27 Waves in the ocean behave similarly to all other types of waves. (credit: Steve Jurveston, Flickr)

      What do we mean when we say something is a wave? The most intuitive and easiest wave to imagine is the familiar
      water wave. More precisely, a wave is a disturbance that propagates, or moves from the place it was created. For
      water waves, the disturbance is in the surface of the water, perhaps created by a rock thrown into a pond or by a
      swimmer splashing the surface repeatedly. For sound waves, the disturbance is a change in air pressure, perhaps
      created by the oscillating cone inside a speaker. For earthquakes, there are several types of disturbances, including
      disturbance of Earth’s surface and pressure disturbances under the surface. Even radio waves are most easily
      understood using an analogy with water waves. Visualizing water waves is useful because there is more to it than
      just a mental image. Water waves exhibit characteristics common to all waves, such as amplitude, period, frequency
      and energy. All wave characteristics can be described by a small set of underlying principles.

      A wave is a disturbance that propagates, or moves from the place it was created. The simplest waves repeat

themselves for several cycles and are associated with simple harmonic motion. Let us start by considering the
simplified water wave in Figure 16.28. The wave is an up and down disturbance of the water surface. It causes a sea
gull to move up and down in simple harmonic motion as the wave crests and troughs (peaks and valleys) pass under
the bird. The time for one complete up and down motion is the wave’s period . The wave’s frequency is              , as
usual. The wave itself moves to the right in the figure. This movement of the wave is actually the disturbance moving
to the right, not the water itself (or the bird would move to the right). We define wave velocity   to be the speed at
which the disturbance moves. Wave velocity is sometimes also called the propagation velocity or propagation
speed, because the disturbance propagates from one location to another.


  Misconception Alert
  Many people think that water waves push water from one direction to another. In fact, the particles of water
  tend to stay in one location, save for moving up and down due to the energy in the wave. The energy moves
  forward through the water, but the water stays in one place. If you feel yourself pushed in an ocean, what you
  feel is the energy of the wave, not a rush of water.




FIGURE 16.28 An idealized ocean wave passes under a sea gull that bobs up and down in simple harmonic motion. The wave has a
wavelength , which is the distance between adjacent identical parts of the wave. The up and down disturbance of the surface propagates
parallel to the surface at a speed .

The water wave in the figure also has a length associated with it, called its wavelength , the distance between
adjacent identical parts of a wave. ( is the distance parallel to the direction of propagation.) The speed of
propagation     is the distance the wave travels in a given time, which is one wavelength in the time of one period.
In equation form, that is

                                                                                                                               16.66

or

This fundamental relationship holds for all types of waves. For water waves,       is the speed of a surface wave; for
sound,    is the speed of sound; and for visible light,   is the speed of light, for example.


  Take-Home Experiment: Waves in a Bowl
  Fill a large bowl or basin with water and wait for the water to settle so there are no ripples. Gently drop a cork
  into the middle of the bowl. Estimate the wavelength and period of oscillation of the water wave that propagates
  away from the cork. Remove the cork from the bowl and wait for the water to settle again. Gently drop the cork
  at a height that is different from the first drop. Does the wavelength depend upon how high above the water the
  cork is dropped?

      Discussion

      This slow speed seems reasonable for an ocean wave. Note that the wave moves to the right in the figure at this
      speed, not the varying speed at which the sea gull moves up and down.


      Transverse and Longitudinal Waves
      A simple wave consists of a periodic disturbance that propagates from one place to another. The wave in Figure
      16.29 propagates in the horizontal direction while the surface is disturbed in the vertical direction. Such a wave is
      called a transverse wave or shear wave; in such a wave, the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of
      propagation. In contrast, in a longitudinal wave or compressional wave, the disturbance is parallel to the direction
      of propagation. Figure 16.30 shows an example of a longitudinal wave. The size of the disturbance is its amplitude X
      and is completely independent of the speed of propagation       .




      FIGURE 16.29 In this example of a transverse wave, the wave propagates horizontally, and the disturbance in the cord is in the vertical
      direction.




      FIGURE 16.30 In this example of a longitudinal wave, the wave propagates horizontally, and the disturbance in the cord is also in the
      horizontal direction.

      Waves may be transverse, longitudinal, or a combination of the two. (Water waves are actually a combination of

      the bird.) The waves on the strings of musical instruments are transverse—so are electromagnetic waves, such as
      visible light.

Sound waves in air and water are longitudinal. Their disturbances are periodic variations in pressure that are
transmitted in fluids. Fluids do not have appreciable shear strength, and thus the sound waves in them must be
longitudinal or compressional. Sound in solids can be both longitudinal and transverse.




FIGURE 16.31 The wave on a guitar string is transverse. The sound wave rattles a sheet of paper in a direction that shows the sound wave
is longitudinal.

Earthquake waves under Earth’s surface also have both longitudinal and transverse components (called
compressional or P-waves and shear or S-waves, respectively). These components have important individual
characteristics—they propagate at different speeds, for example. Earthquakes also have surface waves that are
similar to surface waves on water.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
Why is it important to differentiate between longitudinal and transverse waves?
Solution
In the different types of waves, energy can propagate in a different direction relative to the motion of the wave. This
is important to understand how different types of waves affect the materials around them.

      Most waves do not look very simple. They look more like the waves in Figure 16.32 than like the simple water wave
      considered in Waves. (Simple waves may be created by a simple harmonic oscillation, and thus have a sinusoidal
      shape). Complex waves are more interesting, even beautiful, but they look formidable. Most waves appear complex
      because they result from several simple waves adding together. Luckily, the rules for adding waves are quite simple.

      When two or more waves arrive at the same point, they superimpose themselves on one another. More specifically,
      the disturbances of waves are superimposed when they come together—a phenomenon called superposition. Each
      disturbance corresponds to a force, and forces add. If the disturbances are along the same line, then the resulting
      wave is a simple addition of the disturbances of the individual waves—that is, their amplitudes add. Figure 16.33
      and Figure 16.34 illustrate superposition in two special cases, both of which produce simple results.

      Figure 16.33 shows two identical waves that arrive at the same point exactly in phase. The crests of the two waves
      are precisely aligned, as are the troughs. This superposition produces pure constructive interference. Because the
      disturbances add, pure constructive interference produces a wave that has twice the amplitude of the individual
      waves, but has the same wavelength.

      Figure 16.34 shows two identical waves that arrive exactly out of phase—that is, precisely aligned crest to
      trough—producing pure destructive interference. Because the disturbances are in the opposite direction for this
      superposition, the resulting amplitude is zero for pure destructive interference—the waves completely cancel.




        FIGURE 16.33 Pure constructive interference of two identical waves produces one with twice the amplitude, but the same wavelength.

        FIGURE 16.34 Pure destructive interference of two identical waves produces zero amplitude, or complete cancellation.

While pure constructive and pure destructive interference do occur, they require precisely aligned identical waves.
The superposition of most waves produces a combination of constructive and destructive interference and can vary
from place to place and time to time. Sound from a stereo, for example, can be loud in one spot and quiet in another.
Varying loudness means the sound waves add partially constructively and partially destructively at different
locations. A stereo has at least two speakers creating sound waves, and waves can reflect from walls. All these
waves superimpose. An example of sounds that vary over time from constructive to destructive is found in the
combined whine of airplane jets heard by a stationary passenger. The combined sound can fluctuate up and down in
volume as the sound from the two engines varies in time from constructive to destructive. These examples are of
waves that are similar.

An example of the superposition of two dissimilar waves is shown in Figure 16.35. Here again, the disturbances add
and subtract, producing a more complicated looking wave.




             FIGURE 16.35 Superposition of non-identical waves exhibits both constructive and destructive interference.

Standing Waves
Sometimes waves do not seem to move; rather, they just vibrate in place. Unmoving waves can be seen on the
surface of a glass of milk in a refrigerator, for example. Vibrations from the refrigerator motor create waves on the
milk that oscillate up and down but do not seem to move across the surface. These waves are formed by the
superposition of two or more moving waves, such as illustrated in Figure 16.36 for two identical waves moving in
opposite directions. The waves move through each other with their disturbances adding as they go by. If the two
waves have the same amplitude and wavelength, then they alternate between constructive and destructive
interference. The resultant looks like a wave standing in place and, thus, is called a standing wave. Waves on the
glass of milk are one example of standing waves. There are other standing waves, such as on guitar strings and in
organ pipes. With the glass of milk, the two waves that produce standing waves may come from reflections from the
side of the glass.

A closer look at earthquakes provides evidence for conditions appropriate for resonance, standing waves, and
constructive and destructive interference. A building may be vibrated for several seconds with a driving frequency
matching that of the natural frequency of vibration of the building—producing a resonance resulting in one building
710   16 • Oscillatory Motion and Waves



      collapsing while neighboring buildings do not. Often buildings of a certain height are devastated while other taller
      buildings remain intact. The building height matches the condition for setting up a standing wave for that particular
      height. As the earthquake waves travel along the surface of Earth and reflect off denser rocks, constructive
      interference occurs at certain points. Often areas closer to the epicenter are not damaged while areas farther away
      are damaged.




      FIGURE 16.36 Standing wave created by the superposition of two identical waves moving in opposite directions. The oscillations are at
      fixed locations in space and result from alternately constructive and destructive interference.

      Standing waves are also found on the strings of musical instruments and are due to reflections of waves from the
      ends of the string. Figure 16.37 and Figure 16.38 show three standing waves that can be created on a string that is
      fixed at both ends. Nodes are the points where the string does not move; more generally, nodes are where the wave
      disturbance is zero in a standing wave. The fixed ends of strings must be nodes, too, because the string cannot move
      there. The word antinode is used to denote the location of maximum amplitude in standing waves. Standing waves
      on strings have a frequency that is related to the propagation speed     of the disturbance on the string. The
      wavelength is determined by the distance between the points where the string is fixed in place.

      The lowest frequency, called the fundamental frequency, is thus for the longest wavelength, which is seen to be
                . Therefore, the fundamental frequency is                          . In this case, the overtones or harmonics
      are multiples of the fundamental frequency. As seen in Figure 16.38, the first harmonic can easily be calculated
      since          . Thus,                              . Similarly,          , and so on. All of these frequencies can be
      changed by adjusting the tension in the string. The greater the tension, the greater       is and the higher the
      frequencies. This observation is familiar to anyone who has ever observed a string instrument being tuned. We will
      see in later chapters that standing waves are crucial to many resonance phenomena, such as in sounding boxes on
      string instruments.

Beats
Striking two adjacent keys on a piano produces a warbling combination usually considered to be unpleasant. The
superposition of two waves of similar but not identical frequencies is the culprit. Another example is often
noticeable in jet aircraft, particularly the two-engine variety, while taxiing. The combined sound of the engines goes
up and down in loudness. This varying loudness happens because the sound waves have similar but not identical
frequencies. The discordant warbling of the piano and the fluctuating loudness of the jet engine noise are both due
to alternately constructive and destructive interference as the two waves go in and out of phase. Figure 16.39
illustrates this graphically.




FIGURE 16.39 Beats are produced by the superposition of two waves of slightly different frequencies but identical amplitudes. The waves
alternate in time between constructive interference and destructive interference, giving the resulting wave a time-varying amplitude.

The wave resulting from the superposition of two similar-frequency waves has a frequency that is the average of the
two. This wave fluctuates in amplitude, or beats, with a frequency called the beat frequency. We can determine the
beat frequency by adding two waves together mathematically. Note that a wave can be represented at one point in
space as

      is the beat frequency, and        is the average of    and . These results mean that the resultant wave has twice
      the amplitude and the average frequency of the two superimposed waves, but it also fluctuates in overall amplitude
      at the beat frequency     . The first cosine term in the expression effectively causes the amplitude to go up and
      down. The second cosine term is the wave with frequency           . This result is valid for all types of waves. However, if
      it is a sound wave, providing the two frequencies are similar, then what we hear is an average frequency that gets
      louder and softer (or warbles) at the beat frequency.


        Making Career Connections
        Piano tuners use beats routinely in their work. When comparing a note with a tuning fork, they listen for beats
        and adjust the string until the beats go away (to zero frequency). For example, if the tuning fork has a
        frequency and two beats per second are heard, then the other frequency is either         or         . Most keys hit
        multiple strings, and these strings are actually adjusted until they have nearly the same frequency and give a
        slow beat for richness. Twelve-string guitars and mandolins are also tuned using beats.


      While beats may sometimes be annoying in audible sounds, we will find that beats have many applications.
      Observing beats is a very useful way to compare similar frequencies. There are applications of beats as apparently
      disparate as in ultrasonic imaging and radar speed traps.

      Imagine you are holding one end of a jump rope, and your friend holds the other. If your friend holds her end still,
      you can move your end up and down, creating a transverse wave. If your friend then begins to move her end up and
      down, generating a wave in the opposite direction, what resultant wave forms would you expect to see in the jump
      rope?
      Solution
      The rope would alternate between having waves with amplitudes two times the original amplitude and reaching
      equilibrium with no amplitude at all. The wavelengths will result in both constructive and destructive interference

dull. In another area, the sounds seem excessively loud. Describe how the sound moving about the room could
result in these effects.
Solution
With multiple speakers putting out sounds into the room, and these sounds bouncing off walls, there is bound to be
some wave interference. In the dull areas, the interference is probably mostly destructive. In the louder areas, the
interference is probably mostly constructive.

16.11 Energy in Waves: Intensity
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Calculate the intensity and the power of rays and waves.




FIGURE 16.40 The destructive effect of an earthquake is palpable evidence of the energy carried in these waves. The Richter scale rating of
earthquakes is related to both their amplitude and the energy they carry. (credit: Petty Officer 2nd Class Candice Villarreal, U.S. Navy)

All waves carry energy. The energy of some waves can be directly observed. Earthquakes can shake whole cities to
the ground, performing the work of thousands of wrecking balls.

Loud sounds pulverize nerve cells in the inner ear, causing permanent hearing loss. Ultrasound is used for deep-heat
treatment of muscle strains. A laser beam can burn away a malignancy. Water waves chew up beaches.

The amount of energy in a wave is related to its amplitude. Large-amplitude earthquakes produce large ground
displacements. Loud sounds have higher pressure amplitudes and come from larger-amplitude source vibrations
than soft sounds. Large ocean breakers churn up the shore more than small ones. More quantitatively, a wave is a
displacement that is resisted by a restoring force. The larger the displacement , the larger the force
needed to create it. Because work      is related to force multiplied by distance ( ) and energy is put into the wave
by the work done to create it, the energy in a wave is related to amplitude. In fact, a wave’s energy is directly
proportional to its amplitude squared because

                                                                                                                                  16.74

The energy effects of a wave depend on time as well as amplitude. For example, the longer deep-heat ultrasound is
applied, the more energy it transfers. Waves can also be concentrated or spread out. Sunlight, for example, can be
714   16 • Oscillatory Motion and Waves



      focused to burn wood. Earthquakes spread out, so they do less damage the farther they get from the source. In both
      cases, changing the area the waves cover has important effects. All these pertinent factors are included in the
      definition of intensity as power per unit area:

                                                                                                                       16.75

      where is the power carried by the wave through area . The definition of intensity is valid for any energy in transit,
      including that carried by waves. The SI unit for intensity is watts per square meter (         ). For example, infrared
      and visible energy from the Sun impinge on Earth at an intensity of               just above the atmosphere. There
      are other intensity-related units in use, too. The most common is the decibel. For example, a 90 decibel sound level
      corresponds to an intensity of               . (This quantity is not much power per unit area considering that 90
      decibels is a relatively high sound level. Decibels will be discussed in some detail in a later chapter.

      (b) What intensity would such sunlight have if concentrated by a magnifying glass onto an area 200 times smaller
      than its own?

       EXAMPLE 16.10

Determine the combined intensity of two waves: Perfect constructive interference
If two identical waves are spatially separated, each having an intensity of 1.00 W/m2, interfere perfectly
constructively in a particular location, what is the intensity of the wave at this particular location?

Strategy

We know from Superposition and Interference that when two identical waves, which have equal amplitudes ,
interfere perfectly constructively, the resulting wave has an amplitude of    . Because a wave’s intensity is
proportional to amplitude squared, the intensity of the resulting wave is four times as great as in the individual
waves.

Solution

1. Recall that intensity is proportional to amplitude squared.
2. Calculate the new amplitude:

                                              ′         ′                                                         16.86

3. Recall that the intensity of the old amplitude was:

Discussion

The intensity goes up by a factor of 4 when the amplitude doubles. This answer is a little disquieting. The two
individual waves each have intensities of              , yet their sum has an intensity of           , which may
appear to violate conservation of energy. This violation, of course, cannot happen. What does happen is intriguing.
The area over which the intensity is             is much less than the area covered by the two waves before they
interfered. There are other areas where the intensity is zero. The addition of waves is not as simple as our first look
in Superposition and Interference suggested. We actually get a pattern of both constructive interference and
716   16 • Oscillatory Motion and Waves



      destructive interference whenever two waves are added. For example, if we have two stereo speakers putting out
                    each, there will be places in the room where the intensity is         , other places where the
      intensity is zero, and others in between. Figure 16.41 shows what this interference might look like. We will pursue
      interference patterns elsewhere in this text.




      FIGURE 16.41 These stereo speakers produce both constructive interference and destructive interference in the room, a property common
      to the superposition of all types of waves. The shading is proportional to intensity.

INTRODUCTION TO THE PHYSICS OF HEARING If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it
make a sound? The answer to this old philosophical question depends on how you define sound. If sound only exists
when someone is around to perceive it, then there was no sound. However, if we define sound in terms of physics;
that is, a disturbance of the atoms in matter transmitted from its origin outward (in other words, a wave), then there
was a sound, even if nobody was around to hear it.

Such a wave is the physical phenomenon we call sound. Its perception is hearing. Both the physical phenomenon
and its perception are interesting and will be considered in this text. We shall explore both sound and hearing; they
are related, but are not the same thing. We will also explore the many practical uses of sound waves, such as in
medical imaging.

      17.1 Sound
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define sound and hearing.
       • Describe sound as a longitudinal wave.




      FIGURE 17.2 This glass has been shattered by a high-intensity sound wave of the same frequency as the resonant frequency of the glass.
      While the sound is not visible, the effects of the sound prove its existence. (credit: ||read||, Flickr)

      Sound can be used as a familiar illustration of waves. Because hearing is one of our most important senses, it is
      interesting to see how the physical properties of sound correspond to our perceptions of it. Hearing is the
      perception of sound, just as vision is the perception of visible light. But sound has important applications beyond
      hearing. Ultrasound, for example, is not heard but can be employed to form medical images and is also used in
      treatment.

      The physical phenomenon of sound is defined to be a disturbance of matter that is transmitted from its source
      outward. Sound is a wave. On the atomic scale, it is a disturbance of atoms that is far more ordered than their
      thermal motions. In many instances, sound is a periodic wave, and the atoms undergo simple harmonic motion. In
      this text, we shall explore such periodic sound waves.

      A vibrating string produces a sound wave as illustrated in Figure 17.3, Figure 17.4, and Figure 17.5. As the string
      oscillates back and forth, it transfers energy to the air, mostly as thermal energy created by turbulence. But a small
      part of the string’s energy goes into compressing and expanding the surrounding air, creating slightly higher and
      lower local pressures. These compressions (high pressure regions) and rarefactions (low pressure regions) move out
      as longitudinal pressure waves having the same frequency as the string—they are the disturbance that is a sound
      wave. (Sound waves in air and most fluids are longitudinal, because fluids have almost no shear strength. In solids,
      sound waves can be both transverse and longitudinal.) Figure 17.5 shows a graph of gauge pressure versus distance
      from the vibrating string.

FIGURE 17.4 As the string moves to the left, it creates another compression and rarefaction as the ones on the right move away from the
string.




FIGURE 17.5 After many vibrations, there are a series of compressions and rarefactions moving out from the string as a sound wave. The
graph shows gauge pressure versus distance from the source. Pressures vary only slightly from atmospheric for ordinary sounds.

The amplitude of a sound wave decreases with distance from its source, because the energy of the wave is spread
over a larger and larger area. But it is also absorbed by objects, such as the eardrum in Figure 17.6, and converted to
thermal energy by the viscosity of air. In addition, during each compression a little heat transfers to the air and
during each rarefaction even less heat transfers from the air, so that the heat transfer reduces the organized
disturbance into random thermal motions. (These processes can be viewed as a manifestation of the second law of
thermodynamics presented in Introduction to the Second Law of Thermodynamics: Heat Engines and Their
Efficiency.) Whether the heat transfer from compression to rarefaction is significant depends on how far apart they
are—that is, it depends on wavelength. Wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and speed of propagation are important
for sound, as they are for all waves.




FIGURE 17.6 Sound wave compressions and rarefactions travel up the ear canal and force the eardrum to vibrate. There is a net force on
the eardrum, since the sound wave pressures differ from the atmospheric pressure found behind the eardrum. A complicated mechanism
converts the vibrations to nerve impulses, which are perceived by the person.

      17.2 Speed of Sound, Frequency, and Wavelength
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define pitch.
       • Describe the relationship between the speed of sound, its frequency, and its wavelength.
       • Describe the effects on the speed of sound as it travels through various media.
       • Describe the effects of temperature on the speed of sound.




      FIGURE 17.7 When a firework explodes, the light energy is perceived before the sound energy. Sound travels more slowly than light does.
      (credit: Dominic Alves, Flickr)

      Sound, like all waves, travels at a certain speed and has the properties of frequency and wavelength. You can
      observe direct evidence of the speed of sound while watching a fireworks display. The flash of an explosion is seen
      well before its sound is heard, implying both that sound travels at a finite speed and that it is much slower than light.
      You can also directly sense the frequency of a sound. Perception of frequency is called pitch. The wavelength of
      sound is not directly sensed, but indirect evidence is found in the correlation of the size of musical instruments with
      their pitch. Small instruments, such as a piccolo, typically make high-pitch sounds, while large instruments, such as
      a tuba, typically make low-pitch sounds. High pitch means small wavelength, and the size of a musical instrument is
      directly related to the wavelengths of sound it produces. So a small instrument creates short-wavelength sounds.
      Similar arguments hold that a large instrument creates long-wavelength sounds.

      The relationship of the speed of sound, its frequency, and wavelength is the same as for all waves:
                                                                                                                                        17.1

      distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave—for example, between adjacent compressions as illustrated in
      Figure 17.8. The frequency is the same as that of the source and is the number of waves that pass a point per unit
      time.

Table 17.1 makes it apparent that the speed of sound varies greatly in different media. The speed of sound in a
medium is determined by a combination of the medium’s rigidity (or compressibility in gases) and its density. The
more rigid (or less compressible) the medium, the faster the speed of sound. For materials that have similar
rigidities, sound will travel faster through the one with the lower density because the sound energy is more easily
transferred from particle to particle. The speed of sound in air is low, because air is compressible. Because liquids
and solids are relatively rigid and very difficult to compress, the speed of sound in such media is generally greater
than in gases.

      Earthquakes, essentially sound waves in Earth’s crust, are an interesting example of how the speed of sound
      depends on the rigidity of the medium. Earthquakes have both longitudinal and transverse components, and these
      travel at different speeds. The bulk modulus of granite is greater than its shear modulus. For that reason, the speed
      of longitudinal or pressure waves (P-waves) in earthquakes in granite is significantly higher than the speed of
      transverse or shear waves (S-waves). Both components of earthquakes travel slower in less rigid material, such as
      sediments. P-waves have speeds of 4 to 7 km/s, and S-waves correspondingly range in speed from 2 to 5 km/s, both
      being faster in more rigid material. The P-wave gets progressively farther ahead of the S-wave as they travel through
      Earth’s crust. The time between the P- and S-waves is routinely used to determine the distance to their source, the
      epicenter of the earthquake. The time and nature of these wave differences also provides the evidence for the
      nature of Earth's core. Through careful analysis of seismographic records of large earthquakes whose waves could
      be clearly detected around the world, Richard Dixon Oldham established that waves passing through the center of
      the Earth behaved as if they were moving through a different medium: a liquid. Later on, Inge Lehmann used more
      precise observations (partly based on a better coordinated network of seismographs she helped set up) to better
      define the nature of the core: that it was a solid inner core surrounded by a liquid outer core.

      The speed of sound is affected by temperature in a given medium. For air at sea level, the speed of sound is given by

                                                                                                                        17.2

      where the temperature (denoted as ) is in units of kelvin. The speed of sound in gases is related to the average
      speed of particles in the gas, , and that

                                                                                                                        17.3

      where is the Boltzmann constant (                       ) and is the mass of each (identical) particle in the gas. So, it
      is reasonable that the speed of sound in air and other gases should depend on the square root of temperature. While
      not negligible, this is not a strong dependence. At    , the speed of sound is 331 m/s, whereas at          it is 343
      m/s, less than a 4% increase. Figure 17.9 shows a use of the speed of sound by a bat to sense distances. Echoes are
      also used in medical imaging.

FIGURE 17.9 A bat uses sound echoes to find its way about and to catch prey. The time for the echo to return is directly proportional to the
distance.

One of the more important properties of sound is that its speed is nearly independent of frequency. This
independence is certainly true in open air for sounds in the audible range of 20 to 20,000 Hz. If this independence
were not true, you would certainly notice it for music played by a marching band in a football stadium, for example.
Suppose that high-frequency sounds traveled faster—then the farther you were from the band, the more the sound
from the low-pitch instruments would lag that from the high-pitch ones. But the music from all instruments arrives
in cadence independent of distance, and so all frequencies must travel at nearly the same speed. Recall that
                                                                                                                                     17.4
In a given medium under fixed conditions,    is constant, so that there is a relationship between                       and ; the higher
the frequency, the smaller the wavelength. See Figure 17.10 and consider the following example.




FIGURE 17.10 Because they travel at the same speed in a given medium, low-frequency sounds must have a greater wavelength than high-
frequency sounds. Here, the lower-frequency sounds are emitted by the large speaker, called a woofer, while the higher-frequency sounds
are emitted by the small speaker, called a tweeter.


        EXAMPLE 17.1

Calculating Wavelengths: What Are the Wavelengths of Audible Sounds?
Calculate the wavelengths of sounds at the extremes of the audible range, 20 and 20,000 Hz, in                               air. (Assume
that the frequency values are accurate to two significant figures.)

Strategy

To find wavelength from frequency, we can use                       .

Solution

1. Identify knowns. The value for             , is given by

                                                                                                                                     17.5

2. Convert the temperature into kelvin and then enter the temperature into the equation

                                                                                                                                     17.6

      3. Solve the relationship between speed and wavelength for :
                                                                                                                          17.7

      4. Enter the speed and the minimum frequency to give the maximum wavelength:
                                                                                                                          17.8

      5. Enter the speed and the maximum frequency to give the minimum wavelength:

                                                                                                                          17.9

      Discussion

      Because the product of       multiplied by   equals a constant, the smaller   is, the larger   must be, and vice versa.


      The speed of sound can change when sound travels from one medium to another. However, the frequency usually
      remains the same because it is like a driven oscillation and has the frequency of the original source. If    changes
      and remains the same, then the wavelength must change. That is, because                    , the higher the speed of a
      sound, the greater its wavelength for a given frequency.


        Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Voice as a Sound Wave
        Suspend a sheet of paper so that the top edge of the paper is fixed and the bottom edge is free to move. You
        could tape the top edge of the paper to the edge of a table. Gently blow near the edge of the bottom of the sheet
        and note how the sheet moves. Speak softly and then louder such that the sounds hit the edge of the bottom of
        the paper, and note how the sheet moves. Explain the effects.


           CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
      Imagine you observe two fireworks explode. You hear the explosion of one as soon as you see it. However, you see
      the other firework for several milliseconds before you hear the explosion. Explain why this is so.
      Solution
      Sound and light both travel at definite speeds. The speed of sound is slower than the speed of light. The first
      firework is probably very close by, so the speed difference is not noticeable. The second firework is farther away, so
      the light arrives at your eyes noticeably sooner than the sound wave arrives at your ears.


           CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
      You observe two musical instruments that you cannot identify. One plays high-pitch sounds and the other plays low-
      pitch sounds. How could you determine which is which without hearing either of them play?
      Solution
      Compare their sizes. High-pitch instruments are generally smaller than low-pitch instruments because they
      generate a smaller wavelength.

FIGURE 17.11 Noise on crowded roadways like this one in Delhi makes it hard to hear others unless they shout. (credit: Lingaraj G J, Flickr)

In a quiet forest, you can sometimes hear a single leaf fall to the ground. After settling into bed, you may hear your
blood pulsing through your ears. But when a passing motorist has his stereo turned up, you cannot even hear what
the person next to you in your car is saying. We are all very familiar with the loudness of sounds and aware that they
are related to how energetically the source is vibrating. In cartoons depicting a screaming person (or an animal
making a loud noise), the cartoonist often shows an open mouth with a vibrating uvula, the hanging tissue at the
back of the mouth, to suggest a loud sound coming from the throat Figure 17.12. High noise exposure is hazardous
to hearing, and it is common for musicians to have hearing losses that are sufficiently severe that they interfere with
the musicians’ abilities to perform. The relevant physical quantity is sound intensity, a concept that is valid for all
sounds whether or not they are in the audible range.

Intensity is defined to be the power per unit area carried by a wave. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred
by the wave. In equation form, intensity is

                                                                                                                                   17.10

where is the power through an area . The SI unit for                 is         . The intensity of a sound wave is related to its
amplitude squared by the following relationship:

                                                                                                                                   17.11

Here    is the pressure variation or pressure amplitude (half the difference between the maximum and minimum
pressure in the sound wave) in units of pascals (Pa) or     . (We are using a lower case for pressure to
distinguish it from power, denoted by          above.) The energy (as kinetic energy               ) of an oscillating element of air
due to a traveling sound wave is proportional to its amplitude squared. In this equation, is the density of the
material in which the sound wave travels, in units of         , and   is the speed of sound in the medium, in units of
m/s. The pressure variation is proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation, and so varies as       (Figure
17.12). This relationship is consistent with the fact that the sound wave is produced by some vibration; the greater
its pressure amplitude, the more the air is compressed in the sound it creates.
734   17 • Physics of Hearing




      FIGURE 17.12 Graphs of the gauge pressures in two sound waves of different intensities. The more intense sound is produced by a source
      that has larger-amplitude oscillations and has greater pressure maxima and minima. Because pressures are higher in the greater-intensity
      sound, it can exert larger forces on the objects it encounters.

      Sound intensity levels are quoted in decibels (dB) much more often than sound intensities in watts per meter
      squared. Decibels are the unit of choice in the scientific literature as well as in the popular media. The reasons for
      this choice of units are related to how we perceive sounds. How our ears perceive sound can be more accurately
      described by the logarithm of the intensity rather than directly to the intensity. The sound intensity level in
      decibels of a sound having an intensity in watts per meter squared is defined to be

                                                                                                                                      17.12

      where                       is a reference intensity. In particular,    is the lowest or threshold intensity of sound a
      person with normal hearing can perceive at a frequency of 1000 Hz. Sound intensity level is not the same as
      intensity. Because is defined in terms of a ratio, it is a unitless quantity telling you the level of the sound relative to
      a fixed standard (               , in this case). The units of decibels (dB) are used to indicate this ratio is multiplied by
      10 in its definition. The bel, upon which the decibel is based, is named for Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of
      the telephone.

TABLE 17.2 Sound Intensity Levels and Intensities

The decibel level of a sound having the threshold intensity of                 is          , because             . That
is, the threshold of hearing is 0 decibels. Table 17.2 gives levels in decibels and intensities in watts per meter
squared for some familiar sounds.

One of the more striking things about the intensities in Table 17.2 is that the intensity in watts per meter squared is
quite small for most sounds. The ear is sensitive to as little as a trillionth of a watt per meter squared—even more
impressive when you realize that the area of the eardrum is only about              , so that only     W falls on it at the
threshold of hearing! Air molecules in a sound wave of this intensity vibrate over a distance of less than one
molecular diameter, and the gauge pressures involved are less than              atm.

Another impressive feature of the sounds in Table 17.2 is their numerical range. Sound intensity varies by a factor of
      from threshold to a sound that causes damage in seconds. You are unaware of this tremendous range in sound
intensity because how your ears respond can be described approximately as the logarithm of intensity. Thus, sound
intensity levels in decibels fit your experience better than intensities in watts per meter squared. The decibel scale
is also easier to relate to because most people are more accustomed to dealing with numbers such as 0, 53, or 120
than numbers such as                   .

One more observation readily verified by examining Table 17.2 or using                         is that each factor of 10 in
intensity corresponds to 10 dB. For example, a 90 dB sound compared with a 60 dB sound is 30 dB greater, or three
factors of 10 (that is,   times) as intense. Another example is that if one sound is as intense as another, it is
70 dB higher. See Table 17.3.




1 Several government agencies and health-related professional associations recommend that 85 dB not be exceeded for 8-hour daily
exposures in the absence of hearing protection.

      Calculating Sound Intensity Levels: Sound Waves
      Calculate the sound intensity level in decibels for a sound wave traveling in air at      and having a pressure
      amplitude of 0.656 Pa.

      Strategy

      We are given      , so we can calculate       using the equation                   . Using , we can calculate      straight

      Air has a density of              at atmospheric pressure and           .

      Discussion

      This 87 dB sound has an intensity five times as great as an 80 dB sound. So a factor of five in intensity corresponds
      to a difference of 7 dB in sound intensity level. This value is true for any intensities differing by a factor of five.

Strategy

You are given that the ratio of two intensities is 2 to 1, and are then asked to find the difference in their sound levels
in decibels. You can solve this problem using of the properties of logarithms.

Solution

(1) Identify knowns:

The ratio of the two intensities is 2 to 1, or:

                                                                                                                    17.15

We wish to show that the difference in sound levels is about 3 dB. That is, we want to show:
                                                                                                                    17.16
Note that:

                                                                                                                    17.17

(2) Use the definition of   to get:

                                                                                                                    17.18

Thus,
                                                                                                                    17.19

Discussion

This means that the two sound intensity levels differ by 3.01 dB, or about 3 dB, as advertised. Note that because
only the ratio       is given (and not the actual intensities), this result is true for any intensities that differ by a
factor of two. For example, a 56.0 dB sound is twice as intense as a 53.0 dB sound, a 97.0 dB sound is half as
intense as a 100 dB sound, and so on.


It should be noted at this point that there is another decibel scale in use, called the sound pressure level, based on
the ratio of the pressure amplitude to a reference pressure. This scale is used particularly in applications where
sound travels in water. It is beyond the scope of most introductory texts to treat this scale because it is not
commonly used for sounds in air, but it is important to note that very different decibel levels may be encountered
when sound pressure levels are quoted. For example, ocean noise pollution produced by ships may be as great as
200 dB expressed in the sound pressure level, where the more familiar sound intensity level we use here would be
something under 140 dB for the same sound.

      17.4 Doppler Effect and Sonic Booms
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define Doppler effect, Doppler shift, and sonic boom.
       • Calculate the frequency of a sound heard by someone observing Doppler shift.
       • Describe the sounds produced by objects moving faster than the speed of sound.

      The characteristic sound of a motorcycle buzzing by is an example of the Doppler effect. The high-pitch scream
      shifts dramatically to a lower-pitch roar as the motorcycle passes by a stationary observer. The closer the
      motorcycle brushes by, the more abrupt the shift. The faster the motorcycle moves, the greater the shift. We also
      hear this characteristic shift in frequency for passing race cars, airplanes, and trains. It is so familiar that it is used to
      imply motion and children often mimic it in play.

      The Doppler effect is an alteration in the observed frequency of a sound due to motion of either the source or the
      observer. Although less familiar, this effect is easily noticed for a stationary source and moving observer. For
      example, if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell, you will hear the bell’s frequency shift from high to low as
      you pass by. The actual change in frequency due to relative motion of source and observer is called a Doppler shift.
      The Doppler effect and Doppler shift are named for the Austrian physicist and mathematician Christian Johann
      Doppler (1803–1853), who did experiments with both moving sources and moving observers. Doppler, for example,
      had musicians play on a moving open train car and also play standing next to the train tracks as a train passed by.
      Their music was observed both on and off the train, and changes in frequency were measured.

      What causes the Doppler shift? Figure 17.13, Figure 17.14, and Figure 17.15 compare sound waves emitted by
      stationary and moving sources in a stationary air mass. Each disturbance spreads out spherically from the point
      where the sound was emitted. If the source is stationary, then all of the spheres representing the air compressions
      in the sound wave centered on the same point, and the stationary observers on either side see the same wavelength
      and frequency as emitted by the source, as in Figure 17.13. If the source is moving, as in Figure 17.14, then the
      situation is different. Each compression of the air moves out in a sphere from the point where it was emitted, but the
      point of emission moves. This moving emission point causes the air compressions to be closer together on one side
      and farther apart on the other. Thus, the wavelength is shorter in the direction the source is moving (on the right in
      Figure 17.14), and longer in the opposite direction (on the left in Figure 17.14). Finally, if the observers move, as in
      Figure 17.15, the frequency at which they receive the compressions changes. The observer moving toward the
      source receives them at a higher frequency, and the person moving away from the source receives them at a lower
      frequency.




      FIGURE 17.13 Sounds emitted by a source spread out in spherical waves. Because the source, observers, and air are stationary, the
      wavelength and frequency are the same in all directions and to all observers.

FIGURE 17.14 Sounds emitted by a source moving to the right spread out from the points at which they were emitted. The wavelength is
reduced and, consequently, the frequency is increased in the direction of motion, so that the observer on the right hears a higher-pitch
sound. The opposite is true for the observer on the left, where the wavelength is increased and the frequency is reduced.




FIGURE 17.15 The same effect is produced when the observers move relative to the source. Motion toward the source increases frequency
as the observer on the right passes through more wave crests than she would if stationary. Motion away from the source decreases
frequency as the observer on the left passes through fewer wave crests than he would if stationary.

We know that wavelength and frequency are related by             , where      is the fixed speed of sound. The sound
moves in a medium and has the same speed         in that medium whether the source is moving or not. Thus
multiplied by is a constant. Because the observer on the right in Figure 17.14 receives a shorter wavelength, the
frequency she receives must be higher. Similarly, the observer on the left receives a longer wavelength, and hence
he hears a lower frequency. The same thing happens in Figure 17.15. A higher frequency is received by the observer
moving toward the source, and a lower frequency is received by an observer moving away from the source. In
general, then, relative motion of source and observer toward one another increases the received frequency. Relative
motion apart decreases frequency. The greater the relative speed is, the greater the effect.


  The Doppler Effect
  The Doppler effect occurs not only for sound but for any wave when there is relative motion between the
  observer and the source. There are Doppler shifts in the frequency of sound, light, and water waves, for
  example. Doppler shifts can be used to determine velocity, such as when ultrasound is reflected from blood in a
  medical diagnostic. The recession of galaxies is determined by the shift in the frequencies of light received from
  them and has implied much about the origins of the universe. Modern physics has been profoundly affected by
  observations of Doppler shifts.


For a stationary observer and a moving source, the frequency fobs received by the observer can be shown to be

                                                                                                                                  17.20

where      is the frequency of the source,    is the speed of the source along a line joining the source and observer,
and     is the speed of sound. The minus sign is used for motion toward the observer and the plus sign for motion
away from the observer, producing the appropriate shifts up and down in frequency. Note that the greater the speed
of the source, the greater the effect. Similarly, for a stationary source and moving observer, the frequency received
by the observer        is given by

      where      is the speed of the observer along a line joining the source and observer. Here the plus sign is for motion
      toward the source, and the minus is for motion away from the source.


              EXAMPLE 17.4

      Calculate Doppler Shift: A Train Horn
      Suppose a train that has a 150-Hz horn is moving at 35.0 m/s in still air on a day when the speed of sound is 340 m/
      s.

      (a) What frequencies are observed by a stationary person at the side of the tracks as the train approaches and after
      it passes?

      (b) What frequency is observed by the train’s engineer traveling on the train?

      Strategy

      To find the observed frequency in (a),                        must be used because the source is moving. The minus
      sign is used for the approaching train, and the plus sign for the receding train. In (b), there are two Doppler
      shifts—one for a moving source and the other for a moving observer.

      Solution for (a)

      (1) Enter known values into


                                                                                                                         17.22

      (2) Calculate the frequency observed by a stationary person as the train approaches.
                                                                                                                         17.23
      (3) Use the same equation with the plus sign to find the frequency heard by a stationary person as the train recedes.

                                                                                                                         17.24

      (4) Calculate the second frequency.
                                                                                                                         17.25

      Discussion on (a)

      The numbers calculated are valid when the train is far enough away that the motion is nearly along the line joining
      train and observer. In both cases, the shift is significant and easily noticed. Note that the shift is 17.0 Hz for motion
      toward and 14.0 Hz for motion away. The shifts are not symmetric.

      Solution for (b)

      (1) Identify knowns:

       • It seems reasonable that the engineer would receive the same frequency as emitted by the horn, because the
         relative velocity between them is zero.
       • Relative to the medium (air), the speeds are
       • The first Doppler shift is for the moving observer; the second is for the moving source.

      (2) Use the following equation:

                                                                                                                         17.26

The quantity in the square brackets is the Doppler-shifted frequency due to a moving observer. The factor on the
right is the effect of the moving source.

(3) Because the train engineer is moving in the direction toward the horn, we must use the plus sign for
however, because the horn is also moving in the direction away from the engineer, we also use the plus sign for .
But the train is carrying both the engineer and the horn at the same velocity, so         . As a result, everything
but    cancels, yielding
                                                                                                                                 17.27

Discussion for (b)

We may expect that there is no change in frequency when source and observer move together because it fits your
experience. For example, there is no Doppler shift in the frequency of conversations between driver and passenger
on a motorcycle. People talking when a wind moves the air between them also observe no Doppler shift in their
conversation. The crucial point is that source and observer are not moving relative to each other.


Sonic Booms to Bow Wakes
What happens to the sound produced by a moving source, such as a jet airplane, that approaches or even exceeds
the speed of sound? The answer to this question applies not only to sound but to all other waves as well.

Suppose a jet airplane is coming nearly straight at you, emitting a sound of frequency . The greater the plane’s
speed , the greater the Doppler shift and the greater the value observed for        . Now, as   approaches the
speed of sound,      approaches infinity, because the denominator in                          approaches zero. At the
speed of sound, this result means that in front of the source, each successive wave is superimposed on the previous
one because the source moves forward at the speed of sound. The observer gets them all at the same instant, and
so the frequency is infinite. (Before airplanes exceeded the speed of sound, some people argued it would be
impossible because such constructive superposition would produce pressures great enough to destroy the
airplane.) If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the observer until the source has
passed, so that the sounds from the approaching source are mixed with those from it when receding. This mixing
appears messy, but something interesting happens—a sonic boom is created. (See Figure 17.16.)




FIGURE 17.16 Sound waves from a source that moves faster than the speed of sound spread spherically from the point where they are
emitted, but the source moves ahead of each. Constructive interference along the lines shown (actually a cone in three dimensions) creates
a shock wave called a sonic boom. The faster the speed of the source, the smaller the angle .

There is constructive interference along the lines shown (a cone in three dimensions) from similar sound waves
arriving there simultaneously. This superposition forms a disturbance called a sonic boom, a constructive
interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound. Inside the cone, the interference is mostly
destructive, and so the sound intensity there is much less than on the shock wave. An aircraft creates two sonic
booms, one from its nose and one from its tail. (See Figure 17.17.) During television coverage of space shuttle
landings, two distinct booms could often be heard. These were separated by exactly the time it would take the
shuttle to pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not see the aircraft creating the sonic boom, because it
has passed by before the shock wave reaches them, as seen in Figure 17.17. If the aircraft flies close by at low
altitude, pressures in the sonic boom can be destructive and break windows as well as rattle nerves. Because of
how destructive sonic booms can be, supersonic flights are banned over populated areas of the United States.

        FIGURE 17.17 Two sonic booms, created by the nose and tail of an aircraft, are observed on the ground after the plane has passed by.

      Sonic booms are one example of a broader phenomenon called bow wakes. A bow wake, such as the one in Figure
      17.18, is created when the wave source moves faster than the wave propagation speed. Water waves spread out in
      circles from the point where created, and the bow wake is the familiar V-shaped wake trailing the source. A more
      exotic bow wake is created when a subatomic particle travels through a medium faster than the speed of light
      travels in that medium. (In a vacuum, the maximum speed of light will be                             ; in the medium of
      water, the speed of light is closer to     . If the particle creates light in its passage, that light spreads on a cone
      with an angle indicative of the speed of the particle, as illustrated in Figure 17.19. Such a bow wake is called
      Cerenkov radiation and is commonly observed in particle physics.

      wave action inside the wake, where interference is mostly destructive. (credit: Horia Varlan, Flickr)

      Doppler shifts and sonic booms are interesting sound phenomena that occur in all types of waves. They can be of
      considerable use. For example, the Doppler shift in ultrasound can be used to measure blood velocity, while police
      use the Doppler shift in radar (a microwave) to measure car velocities. In meteorology, the Doppler shift is used to
      track the motion of storm clouds; such “Doppler Radar” can give velocity and direction and rain or snow potential of

imposing weather fronts. In astronomy, we can examine the light emitted from distant galaxies and determine their
speed relative to ours. As galaxies move away from us, their light is shifted to a lower frequency, and so to a longer
wavelength—the so-called red shift. Such information from galaxies far, far away has allowed us to estimate the age
of the universe (from the Big Bang) as about 14 billion years.

Why did scientist Christian Doppler observe musicians both on a moving train and also from a stationary point not on
the train?
Solution
Doppler needed to compare the perception of sound when the observer is stationary and the sound source moves,
as well as when the sound source and the observer are both in motion.

17.5 Sound Interference and Resonance: Standing Waves in Air Columns
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define antinode, node, fundamental, overtones, and harmonics.
 • Identify instances of sound interference in everyday situations.
 • Describe how sound interference occurring inside open and closed tubes changes the characteristics of
    the sound, and how this applies to sounds produced by musical instruments.
 • Calculate the length of a tube using sound wave measurements.

Interference is the hallmark of waves, all of which exhibit constructive and destructive interference exactly
analogous to that seen for water waves. In fact, one way to prove something “is a wave” is to observe interference
effects. So, sound being a wave, we expect it to exhibit interference; we have already mentioned a few such effects,
such as the beats from two similar notes played simultaneously.

Figure 17.21 shows a clever use of sound interference to cancel noise. Larger-scale applications of active noise
reduction by destructive interference are contemplated for entire passenger compartments in commercial aircraft.
To obtain destructive interference, a fast electronic analysis is performed, and a second sound is introduced with its
maxima and minima exactly reversed from the incoming noise. Sound waves in fluids are pressure waves and
consistent with Pascal’s principle; pressures from two different sources add and subtract like simple numbers; that
744   17 • Physics of Hearing



      is, positive and negative gauge pressures add to a much smaller pressure, producing a lower-intensity sound.
      Although completely destructive interference is possible only under the simplest conditions, it is possible to reduce
      noise levels by 30 dB or more using this technique.




      FIGURE 17.21 Headphones designed to cancel noise with destructive interference create a sound wave exactly opposite to the incoming
      sound. These headphones can be more effective than the simple passive attenuation used in most ear protection. Such headphones were
      used on the record-setting, around the world nonstop flight of the Voyager aircraft to protect the pilots’ hearing from engine noise.

      Where else can we observe sound interference? All sound resonances, such as in musical instruments, are due to
      constructive and destructive interference. Only the resonant frequencies interfere constructively to form standing
      waves, while others interfere destructively and are absent. From the toot made by blowing over a bottle, to the
      characteristic flavor of a violin’s sounding box, to the recognizability of a great singer’s voice, resonance and
      standing waves play a vital role.


        Interference
        Interference is such a fundamental aspect of waves that observing interference is proof that something is a
        wave. The wave nature of light was established by experiments showing interference. Similarly, when electrons
        scattered from crystals exhibited interference, their wave nature was confirmed to be exactly as predicted by
        symmetry with certain wave characteristics of light.


      Suppose we hold a tuning fork near the end of a tube that is closed at the other end, as shown in Figure 17.22,
      Figure 17.23, Figure 17.24, and Figure 17.25. If the tuning fork has just the right frequency, the air column in the
      tube resonates loudly, but at most frequencies it vibrates very little. This observation just means that the air column
      has only certain natural frequencies. The figures show how a resonance at the lowest of these natural frequencies is
      formed. A disturbance travels down the tube at the speed of sound and bounces off the closed end. If the tube is
      just the right length, the reflected sound arrives back at the tuning fork exactly half a cycle later, and it interferes
      constructively with the continuing sound produced by the tuning fork. The incoming and reflected sounds form a
      standing wave in the tube as shown.

FIGURE 17.24 Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. If the length of the tube is just right, the disturbance
gets back to the tuning fork half a cycle later and interferes constructively with the continuing sound from the tuning fork. This interference
forms a standing wave, and the air column resonates.




FIGURE 17.25 Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. A graph of air displacement along the length of the
tube shows none at the closed end, where the motion is constrained, and a maximum at the open end. This standing wave has one-fourth
of its wavelength in the tube, so that     .

The standing wave formed in the tube has its maximum air displacement (an antinode) at the open end, where
motion is unconstrained, and no displacement (a node) at the closed end, where air movement is halted. The
distance from a node to an antinode is one-fourth of a wavelength, and this equals the length of the tube; thus,
       . This same resonance can be produced by a vibration introduced at or near the closed end of the tube, as
shown in Figure 17.26. It is best to consider this a natural vibration of the air column independently of how it is
induced.
746   17 • Physics of Hearing




                     FIGURE 17.26 The same standing wave is created in the tube by a vibration introduced near its closed end.

      Given that maximum air displacements are possible at the open end and none at the closed end, there are other,
      shorter wavelengths that can resonate in the tube, such as the one shown in Figure 17.27. Here the standing wave
      has three-fourths of its wavelength in the tube, or          , so that            . Continuing this process reveals a
      whole series of shorter-wavelength and higher-frequency sounds that resonate in the tube. We use specific terms
      for the resonances in any system. The lowest resonant frequency is called the fundamental, while all higher
      resonant frequencies are called overtones. All resonant frequencies are integral multiples of the fundamental, and
      they are collectively called harmonics. The fundamental is the first harmonic, the first overtone is the second
      harmonic, and so on. Figure 17.28 shows the fundamental and the first three overtones (the first four harmonics) in
      a tube closed at one end.




      FIGURE 17.27 Another resonance for a tube closed at one end. This has maximum air displacements at the open end, and none at the
      closed end. The wavelength is shorter, with three-fourths equaling the length of the tube, so that       . This higher-frequency
      vibration is the first overtone.




      FIGURE 17.28 The fundamental and three lowest overtones for a tube closed at one end. All have maximum air displacements at the open
      end and none at the closed end.

      The fundamental and overtones can be present simultaneously in a variety of combinations. For example, middle C
      on a trumpet has a sound distinctively different from middle C on a clarinet, both instruments being modified
      versions of a tube closed at one end. The fundamental frequency is the same (and usually the most intense), but the
      overtones and their mix of intensities are different and subject to shading by the musician. This mix is what gives
      various musical instruments (and human voices) their distinctive characteristics, whether they have air columns,
      strings, sounding boxes, or drumheads. In fact, much of our speech is determined by shaping the cavity formed by

the throat and mouth and positioning the tongue to adjust the fundamental and combination of overtones. Simple
resonant cavities can be made to resonate with the sound of the vowels, for example. (See Figure 17.29.) In males,
at puberty, the larynx grows and the shape of the resonant cavity changes giving rise to the difference in
predominant frequencies in speech between different sexes.




FIGURE 17.29 The throat and mouth form an air column closed at one end that resonates in response to vibrations in the voice box. The
spectrum of overtones and their intensities vary with mouth shaping and tongue position to form different sounds. The voice box can be
replaced with a mechanical vibrator, and understandable speech is still possible. Variations in basic shapes make different voices
recognizable.

Now let us look for a pattern in the resonant frequencies for a simple tube that is closed at one end. The
fundamental has           , and frequency is related to wavelength and the speed of sound as given by:
                                                                                                                                17.28
Solving for    in this equation gives

                                                                                                                                17.29

where       is the speed of sound in air. Similarly, the first overtone has                    (see Figure 17.28), so that

                                                                                                                                17.30

Because           , we call the first overtone the third harmonic. Continuing this process, we see a pattern that can
be generalized in a single expression. The resonant frequencies of a tube closed at one end are

                                                                                                                                17.31

where     is the fundamental,     is the first overtone, and so on. It is interesting that the resonant frequencies
depend on the speed of sound and, hence, on temperature. This dependence poses a noticeable problem for organs
in old unheated cathedrals, and it is also the reason why musicians commonly bring their wind instruments to room
temperature before playing them.


        EXAMPLE 17.5

Find the Length of a Tube with a 128 Hz Fundamental
(a) What length should a tube closed at one end have on a day when the air temperature, is                          , if its
fundamental frequency is to be 128 Hz (C below middle C)?

(b) What is the frequency of its fourth overtone?

Strategy

The length      can be found from the relationship in                    , but we will first need to find the speed of sound             .

      (5) Enter the values of the speed of sound and frequency into the expression for                .

                                                                                                                                     17.35

      Discussion on (a)

      Many wind instruments are modified tubes that have finger holes, valves, and other devices for changing the length
      of the resonating air column and hence, the frequency of the note played. Horns producing very low frequencies,
      such as tubas, require tubes so long that they are coiled into loops.

      Solution for (b)

      (1) Identify knowns:

       •   the first overtone has
       •   the second overtone has
       •   the third overtone has
       •   the fourth overtone has

      (2) Enter the value for the fourth overtone into                   .

                                                                                                                                     17.36

      Discussion on (b)

      Whether this overtone occurs in a simple tube or a musical instrument depends on how it is stimulated to vibrate
      and the details of its shape. The trombone, for example, does not produce its fundamental frequency and only
      makes overtones.


      Another type of tube is one that is open at both ends. Examples are some organ pipes, flutes, and oboes. The
      resonances of tubes open at both ends can be analyzed in a very similar fashion to those for tubes closed at one
      end. The air columns in tubes open at both ends have maximum air displacements at both ends, as illustrated in
      Figure 17.30. Standing waves form as shown.




      FIGURE 17.30 The resonant frequencies of a tube open at both ends are shown, including the fundamental and the first three overtones. In

all cases the maximum air displacements occur at both ends of the tube, giving it different natural frequencies than a tube closed at one
end.

Based on the fact that a tube open at both ends has maximum air displacements at both ends, and using Figure
17.30 as a guide, we can see that the resonant frequencies of a tube open at both ends are:

                                                                                                                                       17.37

where     is the fundamental,     is the first overtone,  is the second overtone, and so on. Note that a tube open at
both ends has a fundamental frequency twice what it would have if closed at one end. It also has a different
spectrum of overtones than a tube closed at one end. So if you had two tubes with the same fundamental frequency
but one was open at both ends and the other was closed at one end, they would sound different when played
because they have different overtones. Middle C, for example, would sound richer played on an open tube, because
it has even multiples of the fundamental as well as odd. A closed tube has only odd multiples.


  Real-World Applications: Resonance in Everyday Systems
  Resonance occurs in many different systems, including strings, air columns, and atoms. Resonance is the driven
  or forced oscillation of a system at its natural frequency. At resonance, energy is transferred rapidly to the
  oscillating system, and the amplitude of its oscillations grows until the system can no longer be described by
  Hooke’s law. An example of this is the distorted sound intentionally produced in certain types of rock music.


Wind instruments use resonance in air columns to amplify tones made by lips or vibrating reeds. Other instruments
also use air resonance in clever ways to amplify sound. Figure 17.31 shows a violin and a guitar, both of which have
sounding boxes but with different shapes, resulting in different overtone structures. The vibrating string creates a
sound that resonates in the sounding box, greatly amplifying the sound and creating overtones that give the
instrument its characteristic flavor. The more complex the shape of the sounding box, the greater its ability to
resonate over a wide range of frequencies. The marimba, like the one shown in Figure 17.32 uses pots or gourds
below the wooden slats to amplify their tones. The resonance of the pot can be adjusted by adding water.

      We have emphasized sound applications in our discussions of resonance and standing waves, but these ideas apply
      to any system that has wave characteristics. Vibrating strings, for example, are actually resonating and have
      fundamentals and overtones similar to those for air columns. More subtle are the resonances in atoms due to the
      wave character of their electrons. Their orbitals can be viewed as standing waves, which have a fundamental
      (ground state) and overtones (excited states). It is fascinating that wave characteristics apply to such a wide range
      of physical systems.

           CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
      How is it possible to use a standing wave's node and antinode to determine the length of a closed-end tube?
      Solution
      When the tube resonates at its natural frequency, the wave's node is located at the closed end of the tube, and the
      antinode is located at the open end. The length of the tube is equal to one-fourth of the wavelength of this wave.
      Thus, if we know the wavelength of the wave, we can determine the length of the tube.

The human ear has a tremendous range and sensitivity. It can give us a wealth of simple information—such as pitch,
loudness, and direction. And from its input we can detect musical quality and nuances of voiced emotion. How is our
hearing related to the physical qualities of sound, and how does the hearing mechanism work?

Hearing is the perception of sound. (Perception is commonly defined to be awareness through the senses, a
typically circular definition of higher-level processes in living organisms.) Normal human hearing encompasses
frequencies from 20 to 20,000 Hz, an impressive range. Sounds below 20 Hz are called infrasound, whereas those
above 20,000 Hz are ultrasound. Neither is perceived by the ear, although infrasound can sometimes be felt as
vibrations. When we do hear low-frequency vibrations, such as the sounds of a diving board, we hear the individual
vibrations only because there are higher-frequency sounds in each. Other animals have hearing ranges different
from that of humans. Dogs can hear sounds as high as 30,000 Hz, whereas bats and dolphins can hear up to
100,000-Hz sounds. You may have noticed that dogs respond to the sound of a dog whistle which produces sound
out of the range of human hearing. Elephants are known to respond to frequencies below 20 Hz.

The perception of frequency is called pitch. Most of us have excellent relative pitch, which means that we can tell
whether one sound has a different frequency from another. Typically, we can discriminate between two sounds if
their frequencies differ by 0.3% or more. For example, 500.0 and 501.5 Hz are noticeably different. Pitch perception
is directly related to frequency and is not greatly affected by other physical quantities such as intensity. Musical
notes are particular sounds that can be produced by most instruments and in Western music have particular names.
Combinations of notes constitute music. Some people can identify musical notes, such as A-sharp, C, or E-flat, just
by listening to them. This uncommon ability is called perfect pitch.

The ear is remarkably sensitive to low-intensity sounds. The lowest audible intensity or threshold is about
                or 0 dB. Sounds as much as        more intense can be briefly tolerated. Very few measuring devices
are capable of observations over a range of a trillion. The perception of intensity is called loudness. At a given
frequency, it is possible to discern differences of about 1 dB, and a change of 3 dB is easily noticed. But loudness is
not related to intensity alone. Frequency has a major effect on how loud a sound seems. The ear has its maximum
sensitivity to frequencies in the range of 2000 to 5000 Hz, so that sounds in this range are perceived as being louder
than, say, those at 500 or 10,000 Hz, even when they all have the same intensity. Sounds near the high- and low-
frequency extremes of the hearing range seem even less loud, because the ear is even less sensitive at those
frequencies. Table 17.4 gives the dependence of certain human hearing perceptions on physical quantities.

                        TABLE 17.4 Sound Perceptions

      When a violin plays middle C, there is no mistaking it for a piano playing the same note. The reason is that each
      instrument produces a distinctive set of frequencies and intensities. We call our perception of these combinations of
      frequencies and intensities tone quality, or more commonly the timbre of the sound. It is more difficult to correlate
      timbre perception to physical quantities than it is for loudness or pitch perception. Timbre is more subjective. Terms
      such as dull, brilliant, warm, cold, pure, and rich are employed to describe the timbre of a sound. So the
      consideration of timbre takes us into the realm of perceptual psychology, where higher-level processes in the brain
      are dominant. This is true for other perceptions of sound, such as music and noise. We shall not delve further into
      them; rather, we will concentrate on the question of loudness perception.

      A unit called a phon is used to express loudness numerically. Phons differ from decibels because the phon is a unit
      of loudness perception, whereas the decibel is a unit of physical intensity. Figure 17.34 shows the relationship of
      loudness to intensity (or intensity level) and frequency for persons with normal hearing. The curved lines are equal-
      loudness curves. Each curve is labeled with its loudness in phons. Any sound along a given curve will be perceived
      as equally loud by the average person. The curves were determined by having large numbers of people compare the
      loudness of sounds at different frequencies and sound intensity levels. At a frequency of 1000 Hz, phons are taken
      to be numerically equal to decibels. The following example helps illustrate how to use the graph:




      FIGURE 17.34 The relationship of loudness in phons to intensity level (in decibels) and intensity (in watts per meter squared) for persons
      with normal hearing. The curved lines are equal-loudness curves—all sounds on a given curve are perceived as equally loud. Phons and
      decibels are defined to be the same at 1000 Hz.


              EXAMPLE 17.6

      Measuring Loudness: Loudness Versus Intensity Level and Frequency
      (a) What is the loudness in phons of a 100-Hz sound that has an intensity level of 80 dB? (b) What is the intensity
      level in decibels of a 4000-Hz sound having a loudness of 70 phons? (c) At what intensity level will an 8000-Hz
      sound have the same loudness as a 200-Hz sound at 60 dB?

      Strategy for (a)

      The graph in Figure 17.34 should be referenced in order to solve this example. To find the loudness of a given sound,
      you must know its frequency and intensity level and locate that point on the square grid, then interpolate between
      loudness curves to get the loudness in phons.

Solution for (a)

(1) Identify knowns:

 • The square grid of the graph relating phons and decibels is a plot of intensity level versus frequency—both
   physical quantities.
 • 100 Hz at 80 dB lies halfway between the curves marked 70 and 80 phons.

(2) Find the loudness: 75 phons.

Strategy for (b)

The graph in Figure 17.34 should be referenced in order to solve this example. To find the intensity level of a sound,
you must have its frequency and loudness. Once that point is located, the intensity level can be determined from the
vertical axis.

Solution for (b)

(1) Identify knowns:

 • Values are given to be 4000 Hz at 70 phons.

(2) Follow the 70-phon curve until it reaches 4000 Hz. At that point, it is below the 70 dB line at about 67 dB.

(3) Find the intensity level:

67 dB

Strategy for (c)

The graph in Figure 17.34 should be referenced in order to solve this example.

Solution for (c)

(1) Locate the point for a 200 Hz and 60 dB sound.

(2) Find the loudness: This point lies just slightly above the 50-phon curve, and so its loudness is 51 phons.

(3) Look for the 51-phon level is at 8000 Hz: 63 dB.

Discussion

These answers, like all information extracted from Figure 17.34, have uncertainties of several phons or several
decibels, partly due to difficulties in interpolation, but mostly related to uncertainties in the equal-loudness curves.


Further examination of the graph in Figure 17.34 reveals some interesting facts about human hearing. First, sounds
below the 0-phon curve are not perceived by most people. So, for example, a 60 Hz sound at 40 dB is inaudible. The
0-phon curve represents the threshold of normal hearing. We can hear some sounds at intensity levels below 0 dB.
For example, a 3-dB, 5000-Hz sound is audible, because it lies above the 0-phon curve. The loudness curves all
have dips in them between about 2000 and 5000 Hz. These dips mean the ear is most sensitive to frequencies in
that range. For example, a 15-dB sound at 4000 Hz has a loudness of 20 phons, the same as a 20-dB sound at 1000
Hz. The curves rise at both extremes of the frequency range, indicating that a greater-intensity level sound is
needed at those frequencies to be perceived to be as loud as at middle frequencies. For example, a sound at 10,000
Hz must have an intensity level of 30 dB to seem as loud as a 20 dB sound at 1000 Hz. Sounds above 120 phons are
painful as well as damaging.

We do not often utilize our full range of hearing. This is particularly true for frequencies above 8000 Hz, which are
rare in the environment and are unnecessary for understanding conversation or appreciating music. In fact, people
who have lost the ability to hear such high frequencies are usually unaware of their loss until tested. The shaded
region in Figure 17.35 is the frequency and intensity region where most conversational sounds fall. The curved lines
indicate what effect hearing losses of 40 and 60 phons will have. A 40-phon hearing loss at all frequencies still
allows a person to understand conversation, although it will seem very quiet. A person with a 60-phon loss at all
754   17 • Physics of Hearing



      frequencies will hear only the lowest frequencies and will not be able to understand speech unless it is much louder
      than normal. Even so, speech may seem indistinct, because higher frequencies are not as well perceived. The
      conversational speech region also has a gender component, in that female voices are usually characterized by
      higher frequencies. So the person with a 60-phon hearing impediment might have difficulty understanding the
      normal conversation of a woman.




      FIGURE 17.35 The shaded region represents frequencies and intensity levels found in normal conversational speech. The 0-phon line
      represents the normal hearing threshold, while those at 40 and 60 represent thresholds for people with 40- and 60-phon hearing losses,
      respectively.

      Hearing tests are performed over a range of frequencies, usually from 250 to 8000 Hz, and can be displayed
      graphically in an audiogram like that in Figure 17.36. The hearing threshold is measured in dB relative to the normal
      threshold, so that normal hearing registers as 0 dB at all frequencies. Hearing loss caused by noise typically shows a
      dip near the 4000 Hz frequency, irrespective of the frequency that caused the loss and often affects both ears. The
      most common form of hearing loss comes with age and is called presbycusis—literally elder ear. Such loss is
      increasingly severe at higher frequencies, and interferes with music appreciation and speech recognition.

      measured relative to the normal threshold. The top left graph is that of a person with normal hearing. The graph to its right has a dip at

4000 Hz and is that of a child who suffered hearing loss due to a cap gun. The third graph is typical of presbycusis, the progressive loss of
higher frequency hearing with age. Tests performed by bone conduction (brackets) can distinguish nerve damage from middle ear damage.


  The Hearing Mechanism
  The hearing mechanism involves some interesting physics. The sound wave that impinges upon our ear is a
  pressure wave. The ear is a transducer that converts sound waves into electrical nerve impulses in a manner
  much more sophisticated than, but analogous to, a microphone. Figure 17.37 shows the gross anatomy of the
  ear with its division into three parts: the outer ear or ear canal; the middle ear, which runs from the eardrum to
  the cochlea; and the inner ear, which is the cochlea itself. The body part normally referred to as the ear is
  technically called the pinna.




                                 FIGURE 17.37 The illustration shows the gross anatomy of the human ear.



The outer ear, or ear canal, carries sound to the recessed protected eardrum. The air column in the ear canal
resonates and is partially responsible for the sensitivity of the ear to sounds in the 2000 to 5000 Hz range. The
middle ear converts sound into mechanical vibrations and applies these vibrations to the cochlea. The lever system
of the middle ear takes the force exerted on the eardrum by sound pressure variations, amplifies it and transmits it
to the inner ear via the oval window, creating pressure waves in the cochlea approximately 40 times greater than
those impinging on the eardrum. (See Figure 17.38.) Two muscles in the middle ear (not shown) protect the inner
ear from very intense sounds. They react to intense sound in a few milliseconds and reduce the force transmitted to
the cochlea. This protective reaction can also be triggered by your own voice, so that humming while shooting a gun,
for example, can reduce noise damage.




FIGURE 17.38 This schematic shows the middle ear’s system for converting sound pressure into force, increasing that force through a lever
system, and applying the increased force to a small area of the cochlea, thereby creating a pressure about 40 times that in the original
sound wave. A protective muscle reaction to intense sounds greatly reduces the mechanical advantage of the lever system.
756   17 • Physics of Hearing



      Figure 17.39 shows the middle and inner ear in greater detail. Pressure waves moving through the cochlea cause
      the tectorial membrane to vibrate, rubbing cilia (called hair cells), which stimulate nerves that send electrical signals
      to the brain. The membrane resonates at different positions for different frequencies, with high frequencies
      stimulating nerves at the near end and low frequencies at the far end. The complete operation of the cochlea is still
      not understood, but several mechanisms for sending information to the brain are known to be involved. For sounds
      below about 1000 Hz, the nerves send signals at the same frequency as the sound. For frequencies greater than
      about 1000 Hz, the nerves signal frequency by position. There is a structure to the cilia, and there are connections
      between nerve cells that perform signal processing before information is sent to the brain. Intensity information is
      partly indicated by the number of nerve signals and by volleys of signals. The brain processes the cochlear nerve
      signals to provide additional information such as source direction (based on time and intensity comparisons of
      sounds from both ears). Higher-level processing produces many nuances, such as music appreciation.




      FIGURE 17.39 The inner ear, or cochlea, is a coiled tube about 3 mm in diameter and 3 cm in length if uncoiled. When the oval window is
      forced inward, as shown, a pressure wave travels through the perilymph in the direction of the arrows, stimulating nerves at the base of cilia
      in the organ of Corti.

      Hearing losses can occur because of problems in the middle or inner ear. Conductive losses in the middle ear can be
      partially overcome by sending sound vibrations to the cochlea through the skull. Hearing aids for this purpose
      usually press against the bone behind the ear, rather than simply amplifying the sound sent into the ear canal as
      many hearing aids do. Damage to the nerves in the cochlea is not repairable, but amplification can partially
      compensate. There is a risk that amplification will produce further damage. Another common failure in the cochlea
      is damage or loss of the cilia but with nerves remaining functional. Cochlear implants that stimulate the nerves
      directly are now available and widely accepted. Over 100,000 implants are in use, in about equal numbers of adults
      and children.

      The cochlear implant was pioneered in Melbourne, Australia, by Graeme Clark in the 1970s for his deaf father. The
      implant consists of three external components and two internal components. The external components are a
      microphone for picking up sound and converting it into an electrical signal, a speech processor to select certain
      frequencies and a transmitter to transfer the signal to the internal components through electromagnetic induction.
      The internal components consist of a receiver/transmitter secured in the bone beneath the skin, which converts the
      signals into electric impulses and sends them through an internal cable to the cochlea and an array of about 24
      electrodes wound through the cochlea. These electrodes in turn send the impulses directly into the brain. The
      electrodes basically emulate the cilia.

17.7 Ultrasound
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define acoustic impedance and intensity reflection coefficient.
 • Describe medical and other uses of ultrasound technology.
 • Calculate acoustic impedance using density values and the speed of ultrasound.
 • Calculate the velocity of a moving object using Doppler-shifted ultrasound.




FIGURE 17.40 Ultrasound is used in medicine to painlessly and noninvasively monitor patient health and diagnose a wide range of
disorders. (credit: abbybatchelder, Flickr)

Any sound with a frequency above 20,000 Hz (or 20 kHz)—that is, above the highest audible frequency—is defined
to be ultrasound. In practice, it is possible to create ultrasound frequencies up to more than a gigahertz. (Higher
frequencies are difficult to create; furthermore, they propagate poorly because they are very strongly absorbed.)
Ultrasound has a tremendous number of applications, which range from burglar alarms to use in cleaning delicate
objects to the guidance systems of bats. We begin our discussion of ultrasound with some of its applications in
medicine, in which it is used extensively both for diagnosis and for therapy.


  Characteristics of Ultrasound
  The characteristics of ultrasound, such as frequency and intensity, are wave properties common to all types of
  waves. Ultrasound also has a wavelength that limits the fineness of detail it can detect. This characteristic is true
  of all waves. We can never observe details significantly smaller than the wavelength of our probe; for example,
  we will never see individual atoms with visible light, because the atoms are so small compared with the
  wavelength of light.


Ultrasound in Medical Therapy
Ultrasound, like any wave, carries energy that can be absorbed by the medium carrying it, producing effects that
vary with intensity. When focused to intensities of      to              , ultrasound can be used to shatter gallstones or
pulverize cancerous tissue in surgical procedures. (See Figure 17.41.) Intensities this great can damage individual
cells, variously causing their protoplasm to stream inside them, altering their permeability, or rupturing their walls
through cavitation. Cavitation is the creation of vapor cavities in a fluid—the longitudinal vibrations in ultrasound
alternatively compress and expand the medium, and at sufficient amplitudes the expansion separates molecules.
Most cavitation damage is done when the cavities collapse, producing even greater shock pressures.
758   17 • Physics of Hearing




      FIGURE 17.41 The tip of this small probe oscillates at 23 kHz with such a large amplitude that it pulverizes tissue on contact. The debris is
      then aspirated. The speed of the tip may exceed the speed of sound in tissue, thus creating shock waves and cavitation, rather than a
      smooth simple harmonic oscillator–type wave.

      Most of the energy carried by high-intensity ultrasound in tissue is converted to thermal energy. In fact, intensities of
           to            are commonly used for deep-heat treatments called ultrasound diathermy. Frequencies of 0.8 to
      1 MHz are typical. In both athletics and physical therapy, ultrasound diathermy is most often applied to injured or
      overworked muscles to relieve pain and improve flexibility. Skill is needed by the therapist to avoid “bone burns”
      and other tissue damage caused by overheating and cavitation, sometimes made worse by reflection and focusing
      of the ultrasound by joint and bone tissue.

      In some instances, you may encounter a different decibel scale, called the sound pressure level, when ultrasound
      travels in water or in human and other biological tissues. We shall not use the scale here, but it is notable that
      numbers for sound pressure levels range 60 to 70 dB higher than you would quote for , the sound intensity level
      used in this text. Should you encounter a sound pressure level of 220 decibels, then, it is not an astronomically high
      intensity, but equivalent to about 155 dB—high enough to destroy tissue, but not as unreasonably high as it might
      seem at first.

      Ultrasound in Medical Diagnostics
      When used for imaging, ultrasonic waves are emitted from a transducer, a crystal exhibiting the piezoelectric effect
      (the expansion and contraction of a substance when a voltage is applied across it, causing a vibration of the crystal).
      These high-frequency vibrations are transmitted into any tissue in contact with the transducer. Similarly, if a
      pressure is applied to the crystal (in the form of a wave reflected off tissue layers), a voltage is produced which can
      be recorded. The crystal therefore acts as both a transmitter and a receiver of sound. Ultrasound is also partially
      absorbed by tissue on its path, both on its journey away from the transducer and on its return journey. From the time
      between when the original signal is sent and when the reflections from various boundaries between media are
      received, (as well as a measure of the intensity loss of the signal), the nature and position of each boundary between
      tissues and organs may be deduced.

      Reflections at boundaries between two different media occur because of differences in a characteristic known as
      the acoustic impedance of each substance. Impedance is defined as
                                                                                                                                           17.38

      where is the density of the medium (in                   ) and     is the speed of sound through the medium (in m/s). The units
      for are therefore            .

      Table 17.5 shows the density and speed of sound through various media (including various soft tissues) and the
      associated acoustic impedances. Note that the acoustic impedances for soft tissue do not vary much but that there
      is a big difference between the acoustic impedance of soft tissue and air and also between soft tissue and bone.

TABLE 17.5 The Ultrasound Properties of Various Media, Including Soft Tissue Found in the Body

At the boundary between media of different acoustic impedances, some of the wave energy is reflected and some is
transmitted. The greater the difference in acoustic impedance between the two media, the greater the reflection
and the smaller the transmission.

The intensity reflection coefficient is defined as the ratio of the intensity of the reflected wave relative to the
incident (transmitted) wave. This statement can be written mathematically as

                                                                                                                 17.39

where      and    are the acoustic impedances of the two media making up the boundary. A reflection coefficient of
zero (corresponding to total transmission and no reflection) occurs when the acoustic impedances of the two media
are the same. An impedance “match” (no reflection) provides an efficient coupling of sound energy from one
medium to another. The image formed in an ultrasound is made by tracking reflections (as shown in Figure 17.42)
and mapping the intensity of the reflected sound waves in a two-dimensional plane.

      This value is the same as the value given for the acoustic impedance of fat tissue.

      Strategy for (b)

      The intensity reflection coefficient for any boundary between two media is given by                                         , and the

      acoustic impedance of muscle is given in Table 17.5.

      Discussion

      This result means that only 1.4% of the incident intensity is reflected, with the remaining being transmitted.


      The applications of ultrasound in medical diagnostics have produced untold benefits with no known risks. Diagnostic
      intensities are too low (about            ) to cause thermal damage. More significantly, ultrasound has been in use
      for several decades and detailed follow-up studies do not show evidence of ill effects, quite unlike the case for x-
      rays.

      depths. (b) Graph of echo intensity versus time. The time for echoes to return is directly proportional to the distance of the reflector,
      yielding this information noninvasively.

      The most common ultrasound applications produce an image like that shown in Figure 17.43. The speaker-
      microphone broadcasts a directional beam, sweeping the beam across the area of interest. This is accomplished by
      having multiple ultrasound sources in the probe’s head, which are phased to interfere constructively in a given,
      adjustable direction. Echoes are measured as a function of position as well as depth. A computer constructs an
      image that reveals the shape and density of internal structures.

How much detail can ultrasound reveal? The image in Figure 17.43 is typical of low-cost systems, but that in Figure
17.44 shows the remarkable detail possible with more advanced systems, including 3D imaging. Ultrasound today is
commonly used in prenatal care. Such imaging can be used to see if the fetus is developing at a normal rate, and
help in the determination of serious problems early in the pregnancy. Ultrasound is also in wide use to image the
chambers of the heart and the flow of blood within the beating heart, using the Doppler effect (echocardiology).

Whenever a wave is used as a probe, it is very difficult to detect details smaller than its wavelength . Indeed,
current technology cannot do quite this well. Abdominal scans may use a 7-MHz frequency, and the speed of sound
in tissue is about 1540 m/s—so the wavelength limit to detail would be                                      . In
practice, 1-mm detail is attainable, which is sufficient for many purposes. Higher-frequency ultrasound would allow
greater detail, but it does not penetrate as well as lower frequencies do. The accepted rule of thumb is that you can
effectively scan to a depth of about       into tissue. For 7 MHz, this penetration limit is              , which is
0.11 m. Higher frequencies may be employed in smaller organs, such as the eye, but are not practical for looking
deep into the body.

In addition to shape information, ultrasonic scans can produce density information superior to that found in X-rays,
because the intensity of a reflected sound is related to changes in density. Sound is most strongly reflected at places
where density changes are greatest.

Another major use of ultrasound in medical diagnostics is to detect motion and determine velocity through the
Doppler shift of an echo, known as Doppler-shifted ultrasound. This technique is used to monitor fetal heartbeat,
measure blood velocity, and detect occlusions in blood vessels, for example. (See Figure 17.45.) The magnitude of
the Doppler shift in an echo is directly proportional to the velocity of whatever reflects the sound. Because an echo
is involved, there is actually a double shift. The first occurs because the reflector (say a fetal heart) is a moving
observer and receives a Doppler-shifted frequency. The reflector then acts as a moving source, producing a second
Doppler shift.

      FIGURE 17.45 This Doppler-shifted ultrasonic image of a partially occluded artery uses color to indicate velocity. The highest velocities are
      in red, while the lowest are blue. The blood must move faster through the constriction to carry the same flow. (credit: Arning C, Grzyska U,
      Wikimedia Commons)

      A clever technique is used to measure the Doppler shift in an echo. The frequency of the echoed sound is
      superimposed on the broadcast frequency, producing beats. The beat frequency is                         , and so it is
      directly proportional to the Doppler shift (       ) and hence, the reflector’s velocity. The advantage in this
      technique is that the Doppler shift is small (because the reflector’s velocity is small), so that great accuracy would
      be needed to measure the shift directly. But measuring the beat frequency is easy, and it is not affected if the
      broadcast frequency varies somewhat. Furthermore, the beat frequency is in the audible range and can be amplified
      for audio feedback to the medical observer.


        Uses for Doppler-Shifted Radar
        Doppler-shifted radar echoes are used to measure wind velocities in storms as well as aircraft and automobile
        speeds. The principle is the same as for Doppler-shifted ultrasound. There is evidence that bats and dolphins
        may also sense the velocity of an object (such as prey) reflecting their ultrasound signals by observing its
        Doppler shift.



              EXAMPLE 17.8

      Calculate Velocity of Blood: Doppler-Shifted Ultrasound
      Ultrasound that has a frequency of 2.50 MHz is sent toward blood in an artery that is moving toward the source at
      20.0 cm/s, as illustrated in Figure 17.46. Use the speed of sound in human tissue as 1540 m/s. (Assume that the
      frequency of 2.50 MHz is accurate to seven significant figures.)

      a. What frequency does the blood receive?
      b. What frequency returns to the source?
      c. What beat frequency is produced if the source and returning frequencies are mixed?

FIGURE 17.46 Ultrasound is partly reflected by blood cells and plasma back toward the speaker-microphone. Because the cells are
moving, two Doppler shifts are produced—one for blood as a moving observer, and the other for the reflected sound coming from a moving
source. The magnitude of the shift is directly proportional to blood velocity.

Strategy

The first two questions can be answered using                                   and                              for the Doppler
shift. The last question asks for beat frequency, which is the difference between the original and returning
frequencies.

      (3) Calculate to find the beat frequency: 649 Hz.

      Discussion

      The Doppler shifts are quite small compared with the original frequency of 2.50 MHz. It is far easier to measure the
      beat frequency than it is to measure the echo frequency with an accuracy great enough to see shifts of a few
      hundred hertz out of a couple of megahertz. Furthermore, variations in the source frequency do not greatly affect
      the beat frequency, because both      and     would increase or decrease. Those changes subtract out in




        Industrial and Other Applications of Ultrasound
        Industrial, retail, and research applications of ultrasound are common. A few are discussed here. Ultrasonic
        cleaners have many uses. Jewelry, machined parts, and other objects that have odd shapes and crevices are
        immersed in a cleaning fluid that is agitated with ultrasound typically about 40 kHz in frequency. The intensity is
        great enough to cause cavitation, which is responsible for most of the cleansing action. Because cavitation-
        produced shock pressures are large and well transmitted in a fluid, they reach into small crevices where even a
        low-surface-tension cleaning fluid might not penetrate.

        Sonar is a familiar application of ultrasound. Sonar typically employs ultrasonic frequencies in the range from
        30.0 to 100 kHz. Bats, dolphins, submarines, and even some birds use ultrasonic sonar. Echoes are analyzed to
        give distance and size information both for guidance and finding prey. In most sonar applications, the sound
        reflects quite well because the objects of interest have significantly different density than the medium in which
        they travel. When the Doppler shift is observed, velocity information can also be obtained. Submarine sonar can
        be used to obtain such information, and there is evidence that some bats also sense velocity from their echoes.

        Similarly, there are a range of relatively inexpensive devices that measure distance by timing ultrasonic echoes.
        Many cameras, for example, use such information to focus automatically. Some doors open when their
        ultrasonic ranging devices detect a nearby object, and certain home security lights turn on when their ultrasonic
        rangers observe motion. Ultrasonic “measuring tapes” also exist to measure such things as room dimensions.
        Sinks in public restrooms are sometimes automated with ultrasound devices to turn faucets on and off when
        people wash their hands. These devices reduce the spread of germs and can conserve water.

        Ultrasound is used for nondestructive testing in industry and by the military. Because ultrasound reflects well
        from any large change in density, it can reveal cracks and voids in solids, such as aircraft wings, that are too
        small to be seen with x-rays. For similar reasons, ultrasound is also good for measuring the thickness of
        coatings, particularly where there are several layers involved.

        Basic research in solid state physics employs ultrasound. Its attenuation is related to a number of physical
        characteristics, making it a useful probe. Among these characteristics are structural changes such as those

 found in liquid crystals, the transition of a material to a superconducting phase, as well as density and other
 properties.

 These examples of the uses of ultrasound are meant to whet the appetites of the curious, as well as to illustrate
 the underlying physics of ultrasound. There are many more applications, as you can easily discover for yourself.

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRIC CHARGE AND ELECTRIC FIELD The image of American politician and scientist
Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) flying a kite in a thunderstorm is familiar to every schoolchild. (See Figure 18.2.) In
this experiment, Franklin demonstrated a connection between lightning and static electricity. Sparks were drawn
from a key hung on a kite string during an electrical storm. These sparks were like those produced by static
electricity, such as the spark that jumps from your finger to a metal doorknob after you walk across a wool carpet.
What Franklin demonstrated in his dangerous experiment was a connection between phenomena on two different
scales: one the grand power of an electrical storm, the other an effect of more human proportions. Connections like
this one reveal the underlying unity of the laws of nature, an aspect we humans find particularly appealing.
774   18 • Electric Charge and Electric Field




      FIGURE 18.2 When Benjamin Franklin demonstrated that lightning was related to static electricity, he made a connection that is now part
      of the evidence that all directly experienced forces except the gravitational force are manifestations of the electromagnetic force.

      Much has been written about Franklin. His experiments were only part of the life of a man who was a scientist,
      inventor, revolutionary, statesman, and writer. Franklin’s experiments were not performed in isolation, nor were they
      the only ones to reveal connections.

      For example, the Italian scientist Luigi Galvani (1737–1798) performed a series of experiments in which static
      electricity was used to stimulate contractions of leg muscles of dead frogs, an effect already known in humans
      subjected to static discharges. But Galvani also found that if he joined two metal wires (say copper and zinc) end to
      end and touched the other ends to muscles, he produced the same effect in frogs as static discharge. Alessandro
      Volta (1745–1827), partly inspired by Galvani’s work, experimented with various combinations of metals and
      developed the battery.

      During the same era, other scientists made progress in discovering fundamental connections. The periodic table
      was developed as the systematic properties of the elements were discovered. This influenced the development and
      refinement of the concept of atoms as the basis of matter. Such submicroscopic descriptions of matter also help
      explain a great deal more.

      Atomic and molecular interactions, such as the forces of friction, cohesion, and adhesion, are now known to be
      manifestations of the electromagnetic force. Static electricity is just one aspect of the electromagnetic force, which
      also includes moving electricity and magnetism.

      All the macroscopic forces that we experience directly, such as the sensations of touch and the tension in a rope, are
      due to the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces in nature. The gravitational force, another
      fundamental force, is actually sensed through the electromagnetic interaction of molecules, such as between those
      in our feet and those on the top of a bathroom scale. (The other two fundamental forces, the strong nuclear force
      and the weak nuclear force, cannot be sensed on the human scale.)

      This chapter begins the study of electromagnetic phenomena at a fundamental level. The next several chapters will
      cover static electricity, moving electricity, and magnetism—collectively known as electromagnetism. In this chapter,
      we begin with the study of electric phenomena due to charges that are at least temporarily stationary, called
      electrostatics, or static electricity.

18.1 Static Electricity and Charge: Conservation of Charge
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 • Define electric charge, and describe how the two types of charge interact.
 • Describe three common situations that generate static electricity.
 • State the law of conservation of charge.




FIGURE 18.3 Borneo amber was mined in Sabah, Malaysia, from shale-sandstone-mudstone veins. When a piece of amber is rubbed with a
piece of silk, the amber gains more electrons, giving it a net negative charge. At the same time, the silk, having lost electrons, becomes
positively charged. (credit: Sebakoamber, Wikimedia Commons)

What makes plastic wrap cling? Static electricity. Not only are applications of static electricity common these days,
its existence has been known since ancient times. The first record of its effects dates to ancient Greeks who noted
more than 500 years B.C. that polishing amber temporarily enabled it to attract bits of straw (see Figure 18.3). The
very word electric derives from the Greek word for amber (electron).

Many of the characteristics of static electricity can be explored by rubbing things together. Rubbing creates the
spark you get from walking across a wool carpet, for example. Static cling generated in a clothes dryer and the
attraction of straw to recently polished amber also result from rubbing. Similarly, lightning results from air
movements under certain weather conditions. You can also rub a balloon on your hair, and the static electricity
created can then make the balloon cling to a wall. We also have to be cautious of static electricity, especially in dry
climates. When we pump gasoline, we are warned to discharge ourselves (after sliding across the seat) on a metal
surface before grabbing the gas nozzle. Attendants in hospital operating rooms must wear booties with a conductive
strip of aluminum foil on the bottoms to avoid creating sparks which may ignite flammable anesthesia gases
combined with the oxygen being used.

Some of the most basic characteristics of static electricity include:

 • The effects of static electricity are explained by a physical quantity not previously introduced, called electric
   charge.
 • There are only two types of charge, one called positive and the other called negative.
 • Like charges repel, whereas unlike charges attract.
 • The force between charges decreases with distance.

How do we know there are two types of electric charge? When various materials are rubbed together in controlled
ways, certain combinations of materials always produce one type of charge on one material and the opposite type
on the other. By convention, we call one type of charge “positive”, and the other type “negative.” For example, when
glass is rubbed with silk, the glass becomes positively charged and the silk negatively charged. Since the glass and
silk have opposite charges, they attract one another like clothes that have rubbed together in a dryer. Two glass rods
rubbed with silk in this manner will repel one another, since each rod has positive charge on it. Similarly, two silk
cloths so rubbed will repel, since both cloths have negative charge. Figure 18.4 shows how these simple materials
can be used to explore the nature of the force between charges.
776   18 • Electric Charge and Electric Field




      FIGURE 18.4 A glass rod becomes positively charged when rubbed with silk, while the silk becomes negatively charged. (a) The glass rod is
      attracted to the silk because their charges are opposite. (b) Two similarly charged glass rods repel. (c) Two similarly charged silk cloths
      repel.

      More sophisticated questions arise. Where do these charges come from? Can you create or destroy charge? Is there
      a smallest unit of charge? Exactly how does the force depend on the amount of charge and the distance between
      charges? Such questions obviously occurred to Benjamin Franklin and other early researchers, and they interest us
      even today.

      Charge Carried by Electrons and Protons
      Franklin wrote in his letters and books that he could see the effects of electric charge but did not understand what
      caused the phenomenon. Today we have the advantage of knowing that normal matter is made of atoms, and that
      atoms contain positive and negative charges, usually in equal amounts.

      Figure 18.5 shows a simple model of an atom with negative electrons orbiting its positive nucleus. The nucleus is
      positive due to the presence of positively charged protons. Nearly all charge in nature is due to electrons and
      protons, which are two of the three building blocks of most matter. (The third is the neutron, which is neutral,
      carrying no charge.) Other charge-carrying particles are observed in cosmic rays and nuclear decay, and are created
      in particle accelerators. All but the electron and proton survive only a short time and are quite rare by comparison.




      FIGURE 18.5 This simplified (and not to scale) view of an atom is called the planetary model of the atom. Negative electrons orbit a much
      heavier positive nucleus, as the planets orbit the much heavier sun. There the similarity ends, because forces in the atom are
      electromagnetic, whereas those in the planetary system are gravitational. Normal macroscopic amounts of matter contain immense
      numbers of atoms and molecules and, hence, even greater numbers of individual negative and positive charges.

      The charges of electrons and protons are identical in magnitude but opposite in sign. Furthermore, all charged
      objects in nature are integral multiples of this basic quantity of charge, meaning that all charges are made of
      combinations of a basic unit of charge. Usually, charges are formed by combinations of electrons and protons. The
      magnitude of this basic charge is

                                                                                                                                          18.1

      The symbol      is commonly used for charge and the subscript indicates the charge of a single electron (or proton).

      The SI unit of charge is the coulomb (C). The number of protons needed to make a charge of 1.00 C is

                                                                                                                                        18.2

Similarly,            electrons have a combined charge of −1.00 coulomb. Just as there is a smallest bit of an
element (an atom), there is a smallest bit of charge. There is no directly observed charge smaller than  (see
Things Great and Small: The Submicroscopic Origin of Charge), and all observed charges are integral multiples of
    .


  Things Great and Small: The Submicroscopic Origin of Charge
  With the exception of exotic, short-lived particles, all charge in nature is carried by electrons and protons.
  Electrons carry the charge we have named negative. Protons carry an equal-magnitude charge that we call
  positive. (See Figure 18.6.) Electron and proton charges are considered fundamental building blocks, since all
  other charges are integral multiples of those carried by electrons and protons. Electrons and protons are also
  two of the three fundamental building blocks of ordinary matter. The neutron is the third and has zero total
  charge.


Figure 18.6 shows a person touching a Van de Graaff generator and receiving excess positive charge. The expanded
view of a hair shows the existence of both types of charges but an excess of positive. The repulsion of these positive
like charges causes the strands of hair to repel other strands of hair and to stand up. The further blowup shows an
artist’s conception of an electron and a proton perhaps found in an atom in a strand of hair.




FIGURE 18.6 When this person touches a Van de Graaff generator, some electrons are attracted to the generator, resulting in an excess of
positive charge, causing her hair to stand on end. The charges in one hair are shown. An artist’s conception of an electron and a proton
illustrate the particles carrying the negative and positive charges. We cannot really see these particles with visible light because they are so
small (the electron seems to be an infinitesimal point), but we know a great deal about their measurable properties, such as the charges
they carry.

The electron seems to have no substructure; in contrast, when the substructure of protons is explored by scattering
extremely energetic electrons from them, it appears that there are point-like particles inside the proton. These sub-
particles, named quarks, have never been directly observed, but they are believed to carry fractional charges as
seen in Figure 18.7. Charges on electrons and protons and all other directly observable particles are unitary, but
these quark substructures carry charges of either     or    . There are continuing attempts to observe fractional
charge directly and to learn of the properties of quarks, which are perhaps the ultimate substructure of matter.

      charge on the proton:                              .

      Separation of Charge in Atoms
      Charges in atoms and molecules can be separated—for example, by rubbing materials together. Some atoms and
      molecules have a greater affinity for electrons than others and will become negatively charged by close contact in
      rubbing, leaving the other material positively charged. (See Figure 18.8.) Positive charge can similarly be induced by
      rubbing. Methods other than rubbing can also separate charges. Batteries, for example, use combinations of
      substances that interact in such a way as to separate charges. Chemical interactions may transfer negative charge
      from one substance to the other, making one battery terminal negative and leaving the first one positive.




      FIGURE 18.8 When materials are rubbed together, charges can be separated, particularly if one material has a greater affinity for electrons
      than another. (a) Both the amber and cloth are originally neutral, with equal positive and negative charges. Only a tiny fraction of the
      charges are involved, and only a few of them are shown here. (b) When rubbed together, some negative charge is transferred to the amber,
      leaving the cloth with a net positive charge. (c) When separated, the amber and cloth now have net charges, but the absolute value of the
      net positive and negative charges will be equal.

      No charge is actually created or destroyed when charges are separated as we have been discussing. Rather, existing
      charges are moved about. In fact, in all situations the total amount of charge is always constant. This universally
      obeyed law of nature is called the law of conservation of charge.


        Law of Conservation of Charge
        Total charge is constant in any process.


      In more exotic situations, such as in particle accelerators, mass, , can be created from energy in the amount
               . Sometimes, the created mass is charged, such as when an electron is created. Whenever a charged
      particle is created, another having an opposite charge is always created along with it, so that the total charge
      created is zero. Usually, the two particles are “matter-antimatter” counterparts. For example, an antielectron would
      usually be created at the same time as an electron. The antielectron has a positive charge (it is called a positron),
      and so the total charge created is zero. (See Figure 18.9.) All particles have antimatter counterparts with opposite
      signs. When matter and antimatter counterparts are brought together, they completely annihilate one another. By

annihilate, we mean that the mass of the two particles is converted to energy E, again obeying the relationship
          . Since the two particles have equal and opposite charge, the total charge is zero before and after the
annihilation; thus, total charge is conserved.


  Making Connections: Conservation Laws
  Only a limited number of physical quantities are universally conserved. Charge is one—energy, momentum, and
  angular momentum are others. Because they are conserved, these physical quantities are used to explain more
  phenomena and form more connections than other, less basic quantities. We find that conserved quantities give
  us great insight into the rules followed by nature and hints to the organization of nature. Discoveries of
  conservation laws have led to further discoveries, such as the weak nuclear force and the quark substructure of
  protons and other particles.




FIGURE 18.9 (a) When enough energy is present, it can be converted into matter. Here the matter created is an electron–antielectron pair. (
   is the electron’s mass.) The total charge before and after this event is zero. (b) When matter and antimatter collide, they annihilate each
other; the total charge is conserved at zero before and after the annihilation.

The law of conservation of charge is absolute—it has never been observed to be violated. Charge, then, is a special
physical quantity, joining a very short list of other quantities in nature that are always conserved. Other conserved
quantities include energy, momentum, and angular momentum.

      18.2 Conductors and Insulators
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Define conductor and insulator, explain the difference, and give examples of each.
       • Describe three methods for charging an object.
       • Explain what happens to an electric force as you move farther from the source.
       • Define polarization.




      FIGURE 18.10 This power adapter uses metal wires and connectors to conduct electricity from the wall socket to a laptop computer. The
      conducting wires allow electrons to move freely through the cables, which are shielded by rubber and plastic. These materials act as
      insulators that don’t allow electric charge to escape outward. (credit: Evan-Amos, Wikimedia Commons)

      Some substances, such as metals and salty water, allow charges to move through them with relative ease. Some of
      the electrons in metals and similar conductors are not bound to individual atoms or sites in the material. These free
      electrons can move through the material much as air moves through loose sand. Any substance that has free
      electrons and allows charge to move relatively freely through it is called a conductor. The moving electrons may
      collide with fixed atoms and molecules, losing some energy, but they can move in a conductor. Superconductors
      allow the movement of charge without any loss of energy. Salty water and other similar conducting materials contain
      free ions that can move through them. An ion is an atom or molecule having a positive or negative (nonzero) total
      charge. In other words, the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons.

      Other substances, such as glass, do not allow charges to move through them. These are called insulators. Electrons
      and ions in insulators are bound in the structure and cannot move easily—as much as        times more slowly than
      in conductors. Pure water and dry table salt are insulators, for example, whereas molten salt and salty water are
      conductors.




      FIGURE 18.11 An electroscope is a favorite instrument in physics demonstrations and student laboratories. It is typically made with gold
      foil leaves hung from a (conducting) metal stem and is insulated from the room air in a glass-walled container. (a) A positively charged glass
      rod is brought near the tip of the electroscope, attracting electrons to the top and leaving a net positive charge on the leaves. Like charges in
      the light flexible gold leaves repel, separating them. (b) When the rod is touched against the ball, electrons are attracted and transferred,
      reducing the net charge on the glass rod but leaving the electroscope positively charged. (c) The excess charges are evenly distributed in
      the stem and leaves of the electroscope once the glass rod is removed.

      Charging by Contact
      Figure 18.11 shows an electroscope being charged by touching it with a positively charged glass rod. Because the
      glass rod is an insulator, it must actually touch the electroscope to transfer charge to or from it. (Note that the extra
      positive charges reside on the surface of the glass rod as a result of rubbing it with silk before starting the

experiment.) Since only electrons move in metals, we see that they are attracted to the top of the electroscope.
There, some are transferred to the positive rod by touch, leaving the electroscope with a net positive charge.

Electrostatic repulsion in the leaves of the charged electroscope separates them. The electrostatic force has a
horizontal component that results in the leaves moving apart as well as a vertical component that is balanced by the
gravitational force. Similarly, the electroscope can be negatively charged by contact with a negatively charged
object.

Charging by Induction
It is not necessary to transfer excess charge directly to an object in order to charge it. Figure 18.12 shows a method
of induction wherein a charge is created in a nearby object, without direct contact. Here we see two neutral metal
spheres in contact with one another but insulated from the rest of the world. A positively charged rod is brought
near one of them, attracting negative charge to that side, leaving the other sphere positively charged.

This is an example of induced polarization of neutral objects. Polarization is the separation of charges in an object
that remains neutral. If the spheres are now separated (before the rod is pulled away), each sphere will have a net
charge. Note that the object closest to the charged rod receives an opposite charge when charged by induction. Note
also that no charge is removed from the charged rod, so that this process can be repeated without depleting the
supply of excess charge.

Another method of charging by induction is shown in Figure 18.13. The neutral metal sphere is polarized when a
charged rod is brought near it. The sphere is then grounded, meaning that a conducting wire is run from the sphere
to the ground. Since the earth is large and most ground is a good conductor, it can supply or accept excess charge
easily. In this case, electrons are attracted to the sphere through a wire called the ground wire, because it supplies a
conducting path to the ground. The ground connection is broken before the charged rod is removed, leaving the
sphere with an excess charge opposite to that of the rod. Again, an opposite charge is achieved when charging by
induction and the charged rod loses none of its excess charge.

of the world. (b) A positively charged glass rod is brought near the sphere on the left, attracting negative charge and leaving the other

      sphere positively charged. (c) The spheres are separated before the rod is removed, thus separating negative and positive charge. (d) The
      spheres retain net charges after the inducing rod is removed—without ever having been touched by a charged object.




      FIGURE 18.13 Charging by induction, using a ground connection. (a) A positively charged rod is brought near a neutral metal sphere,
      polarizing it. (b) The sphere is grounded, allowing electrons to be attracted from the earth’s ample supply. (c) The ground connection is
      broken. (d) The positive rod is removed, leaving the sphere with an induced negative charge.




      FIGURE 18.14 Both positive and negative objects attract a neutral object by polarizing its molecules. (a) A positive object brought near a
      neutral insulator polarizes its molecules. There is a slight shift in the distribution of the electrons orbiting the molecule, with unlike charges
      being brought nearer and like charges moved away. Since the electrostatic force decreases with distance, there is a net attraction. (b) A
      negative object produces the opposite polarization, but again attracts the neutral object. (c) The same effect occurs for a conductor; since
      the unlike charges are closer, there is a net attraction.

      Neutral objects can be attracted to any charged object. The pieces of straw attracted to polished amber are neutral,
      for example. If you run a plastic comb through your hair, the charged comb can pick up neutral pieces of paper.
      Figure 18.14 shows how the polarization of atoms and molecules in neutral objects results in their attraction to a
      charged object.

      When a charged rod is brought near a neutral substance, an insulator in this case, the distribution of charge in atoms
      and molecules is shifted slightly. Opposite charge is attracted nearer the external charged rod, while like charge is
      repelled. Since the electrostatic force decreases with distance, the repulsion of like charges is weaker than the
      attraction of unlike charges, and so there is a net attraction. Thus a positively charged glass rod attracts neutral
      pieces of paper, as will a negatively charged rubber rod. Some molecules, like water, are polar molecules. Polar
      molecules have a natural or inherent separation of charge, although they are neutral overall. Polar molecules are
      particularly affected by other charged objects and show greater polarization effects than molecules with naturally
      uniform charge distributions.

Water molecules are polarized, giving them slightly positive and slightly negative sides. This makes water even more
susceptible to a charged rod’s attraction. In addition, tap water contains dissolved ions (positive and negative
charges). As the water flows downward, due to the force of gravity, the charged conductor exerts a net attraction to
the opposite charges in the stream of water, pulling it closer.

      FIGURE 18.16 This NASA image of Arp 87 shows the result of a strong gravitational attraction between two galaxies. In contrast, at the
      subatomic level, the electrostatic attraction between two objects, such as an electron and a proton, is far greater than their mutual
      attraction due to gravity. (credit: NASA/HST)

      Through the work of scientists in the late 18th century, the main features of the electrostatic force—the existence
      of two types of charge, the observation that like charges repel, unlike charges attract, and the decrease of force with
      distance—were eventually refined, and expressed as a mathematical formula. The mathematical formula for the
      electrostatic force is called Coulomb’s law after the French physicist Charles Coulomb (1736–1806), who
      performed experiments and first proposed a formula to calculate it.


        Coulomb’s Law

                                                                                                                                       18.3

        Coulomb’s law calculates the magnitude of the force               between two point charges,           and      , separated by a
        distance . In SI units, the constant is equal to

                                                                                                                                       18.4

        The electrostatic force is a vector quantity and is expressed in units of newtons. The force is understood to be
        along the line joining the two charges. (See Figure 18.17.)


      Although the formula for Coulomb’s law is simple, it was no mean task to prove it. The experiments Coulomb did,
      with the primitive equipment then available, were difficult. Modern experiments have verified Coulomb’s law to
      great precision. For example, it has been shown that the force is inversely proportional to distance between two
      objects squared              to an accuracy of 1 part in      . No exceptions have ever been found, even at the small
      distances within the atom.




      FIGURE 18.17 The magnitude of the electrostatic force between point charges           and     separated by a distance is given by Coulomb’s
      law. Note that Newton’s third law (every force exerted creates an equal and opposite force) applies as usual—the force on     is equal in
      magnitude and opposite in direction to the force it exerts on . (a) Like charges. (b) Unlike charges.

Strategy

To compare the two forces, we first compute the electrostatic force using Coulomb’s law,                    . We then
calculate the gravitational force using Newton’s universal law of gravitation. Finally, we take a ratio to see how the
forces compare in magnitude.

Solution

Entering the given and known information about the charges and separation of the electron and proton into the
expression of Coulomb’s law yields

                                                                                                                        18.5



                                                                                                                        18.6


Thus the Coulomb force is

                                                                                                                        18.7

The charges are opposite in sign, so this is an attractive force. This is a very large force for an electron—it would
cause an acceleration of                     (verification is left as an end-of-section problem).The gravitational force
is given by Newton’s law of gravitation as:

                                                                                                                        18.8

where                                 . Here and      represent the electron and proton masses, which can be
found in the appendices. Entering values for the knowns yields

                                                                                                                        18.9

This is also an attractive force, although it is traditionally shown as positive since gravitational force is always
attractive. The ratio of the magnitude of the electrostatic force to gravitational force in this case is, thus,

                                                                                                                       18.10

Discussion

This is a remarkably large ratio! Note that this will be the ratio of electrostatic force to gravitational force for an
electron and a proton at any distance (taking the ratio before entering numerical values shows that the distance
cancels). This ratio gives some indication of just how much larger the Coulomb force is than the gravitational force
between two of the most common particles in nature.


As the example implies, gravitational force is completely negligible on a small scale, where the interactions of
individual charged particles are important. On a large scale, such as between the Earth and a person, the reverse is
true. Most objects are nearly electrically neutral, and so attractive and repulsive Coulomb forces nearly cancel.
Gravitational force on a large scale dominates interactions between large objects because it is always attractive,
while Coulomb forces tend to cancel.

      18.4 Electric Field: Concept of a Field Revisited
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Describe a force field and calculate the strength of an electric field due to a point charge.
       • Calculate the force exerted on a test charge by an electric field.
       • Explain the relationship between electrical force (F) on a test charge and electrical field strength (E).

      Contact forces, such as between a baseball and a bat, are explained on the small scale by the interaction of the
      charges in atoms and molecules in close proximity. They interact through forces that include the Coulomb force.
      Action at a distance is a force between objects that are not close enough for their atoms to “touch.” That is, they are
      separated by more than a few atomic diameters.

      For example, a charged rubber comb attracts neutral bits of paper from a distance via the Coulomb force. It is very
      useful to think of an object being surrounded in space by a force field. The force field carries the force to another
      object (called a test object) some distance away.

      Concept of a Field
      A field is a way of conceptualizing and mapping the force that surrounds any object and acts on another object at a
      distance without apparent physical connection. For example, the gravitational field surrounding the earth (and all
      other masses) represents the gravitational force that would be experienced if another mass were placed at a given
      point within the field.

      In the same way, the Coulomb force field surrounding any charge extends throughout space. Using Coulomb’s law,
                      , its magnitude is given by the equation             , for a point charge (a particle having a
      charge ) acting on a test charge at a distance (see Figure 18.18). Both the magnitude and direction of the
      Coulomb force field depend on and the test charge .




      FIGURE 18.18 The Coulomb force field due to a positive charge is shown acting on two different charges. Both charges are the same
      distance from . (a) Since    is positive, the force     acting on it is repulsive. (b) The charge    is negative and greater in magnitude than
         , and so the force  acting on it is attractive and stronger than      . The Coulomb force field is thus not unique at any point in space,
      because it depends on the test charges      and     as well as the charge .

      To simplify things, we would prefer to have a field that depends only on and not on the test charge . The electric
      field is defined in such a manner that it represents only the charge creating it and is unique at every point in space.
      Specifically, the electric field is defined to be the ratio of the Coulomb force to the test charge:

                                                                                                                                             18.11

      where is the electrostatic force (or Coulomb force) exerted on a positive test charge . It is understood that is in
      the same direction as . It is also assumed that is so small that it does not alter the charge distribution creating
      the electric field. The units of electric field are newtons per coulomb (N/C). If the electric field is known, then the
      electrostatic force on any charge is simply obtained by multiplying charge times electric field, or              . Consider
      the electric field due to a point charge . According to Coulomb’s law, the force it exerts on a test charge is

                . Thus the magnitude of the electric field,    , for a point charge is

                                                                                                                         18.12

Since the test charge cancels, we see that

                                                                                                                         18.13

The electric field is thus seen to depend only on the charge       and the distance ; it is completely independent of the
test charge .


       EXAMPLE 18.2

Calculating the Electric Field of a Point Charge
Calculate the strength and direction of the electric field     due to a point charge of 2.00 nC (nano-Coulombs) at a
distance of 5.00 mm from the charge.

Strategy

We can find the electric field created by a point charge by using the equation                  .

Solution

Here                     C and                    m. Entering those values into the above equation gives



                                                                                                                         18.14



Discussion

This electric field strength is the same at any point 5.00 mm away from the charge            that creates the field. It is
positive, meaning that it has a direction pointing away from the charge .



       EXAMPLE 18.3

Calculating the Force Exerted on a Point Charge by an Electric Field
What force does the electric field found in the previous example exert on a point charge of                    ?

Strategy

Since we know the electric field strength and the charge in the field, the force on that charge can be calculated using
the definition of electric field       rearranged to         .

Solution

The magnitude of the force on a charge                       exerted by a field of strength                     N/C is thus,


                                                                                                                         18.15


Because    is negative, the force is directed opposite to the direction of the field.
788   18 • Electric Charge and Electric Field



      Discussion

      The force is attractive, as expected for unlike charges. (The field was created by a positive charge and here acts on a
      negative charge.) The charges in this example are typical of common static electricity, and the modest attractive
      force obtained is similar to forces experienced in static cling and similar situations.

      18.5 Electric Field Lines: Multiple Charges
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Calculate the total force (magnitude and direction) exerted on a test charge from more than one charge
       • Describe an electric field diagram of a positive point charge; of a negative point charge with twice the
          magnitude of positive charge
       • Draw the electric field lines between two points of the same charge; between two points of opposite
          charge.

      Drawings using lines to represent electric fields around charged objects are very useful in visualizing field strength
      and direction. Since the electric field has both magnitude and direction, it is a vector. Like all vectors, the electric
      field can be represented by an arrow that has length proportional to its magnitude and that points in the correct
      direction. (We have used arrows extensively to represent force vectors, for example.)

      Figure 18.19 shows two pictorial representations of the same electric field created by a positive point charge .
      Figure 18.19 (b) shows the standard representation using continuous lines. Figure 18.19 (a) shows numerous
      individual arrows with each arrow representing the force on a test charge . Field lines are essentially a map of
      infinitesimal force vectors.




      FIGURE 18.19 Two equivalent representations of the electric field due to a positive charge . (a) Arrows representing the electric field’s
      magnitude and direction. (b) In the standard representation, the arrows are replaced by continuous field lines having the same direction at
      any point as the electric field. The closeness of the lines is directly related to the strength of the electric field. A test charge placed
      anywhere will feel a force in the direction of the field line; this force will have a strength proportional to the density of the lines (being
      greater near the charge, for example).

      Note that the electric field is defined for a positive test charge , so that the field lines point away from a positive
      charge and toward a negative charge. (See Figure 18.20.) The electric field strength is exactly proportional to the
      number of field lines per unit area, since the magnitude of the electric field for a point charge is               and
      area is proportional to . This pictorial representation, in which field lines represent the direction and their
      closeness (that is, their areal density or the number of lines crossing a unit area) represents strength, is used for all
      fields: electrostatic, gravitational, magnetic, and others.

FIGURE 18.20 The electric field surrounding three different point charges. (a) A positive charge. (b) A negative charge of equal magnitude.
(c) A larger negative charge.

In many situations, there are multiple charges. The total electric field created by multiple charges is the vector sum
of the individual fields created by each charge. The following example shows how to add electric field vectors.


        EXAMPLE 18.4

Adding Electric Fields
Find the magnitude and direction of the total electric field due to the two point charges,                   and      , at the origin of
the coordinate system as shown in Figure 18.21.




                                  FIGURE 18.21 The electric fields     and     at the origin O add to    .

Strategy

Since the electric field is a vector (having magnitude and direction), we add electric fields with the same vector
techniques used for other types of vectors. We first must find the electric field due to each charge at the point of
interest, which is the origin of the coordinate system (O) in this instance. We pretend that there is a positive test
charge, , at point O, which allows us to determine the direction of the fields     and      . Once those fields are
found, the total field can be determined using vector addition.

Solution

The electric field strength at the origin due to          is labeled       and is calculated:



                                                                                                                                   18.16



Similarly,      is



                                                                                                                                   18.17



Four digits have been retained in this solution to illustrate that              is exactly twice the magnitude of           . Now arrows
790   18 • Electric Charge and Electric Field



      are drawn to represent the magnitudes and directions of            and    . (See Figure 18.21.) The direction of the electric
      field is that of the force on a positive charge so both arrows point directly away from the positive charges that create
      them. The arrow for        is exactly twice the length of that for    . The arrows form a right triangle in this case and
      can be added using the Pythagorean theorem. The magnitude of the total field              is



                                                                                                                           18.18



      The direction is



                                                                                                                           18.19



      or       above the x-axis.

      Discussion

      In cases where the electric field vectors to be added are not perpendicular, vector components or graphical
      techniques can be used. The total electric field found in this example is the total electric field at only one point in
      space. To find the total electric field due to these two charges over an entire region, the same technique must be
      repeated for each point in the region. This impossibly lengthy task (there are an infinite number of points in space)
      can be avoided by calculating the total field at representative points and using some of the unifying features noted
      next.


      Figure 18.22 shows how the electric field from two point charges can be drawn by finding the total field at
      representative points and drawing electric field lines consistent with those points. While the electric fields from
      multiple charges are more complex than those of single charges, some simple features are easily noticed.

      For example, the field is weaker between like charges, as shown by the lines being farther apart in that region. (This
      is because the fields from each charge exert opposing forces on any charge placed between them.) (See Figure
      18.22 and Figure 18.23(a).) Furthermore, at a great distance from two like charges, the field becomes identical to
      the field from a single, larger charge.

      Figure 18.23(b) shows the electric field of two unlike charges. The field is stronger between the charges. In that
      region, the fields from each charge are in the same direction, and so their strengths add. The field of two unlike
      charges is weak at large distances, because the fields of the individual charges are in opposite directions and so
      their strengths subtract. At very large distances, the field of two unlike charges looks like that of a smaller single
      charge.

FIGURE 18.22 Two positive point charges       and    produce the resultant electric field shown. The field is calculated at representative
points and then smooth field lines drawn following the rules outlined in the text.




FIGURE 18.23 (a) Two negative charges produce the fields shown. It is very similar to the field produced by two positive charges, except
that the directions are reversed. The field is clearly weaker between the charges. The individual forces on a test charge in that region are in
opposite directions. (b) Two opposite charges produce the field shown, which is stronger in the region between the charges.

We use electric field lines to visualize and analyze electric fields (the lines are a pictorial tool, not a physical entity in
themselves). The properties of electric field lines for any charge distribution can be summarized as follows:

1. Field lines must begin on positive charges and terminate on negative charges, or at infinity in the hypothetical
   case of isolated charges.
2. The number of field lines leaving a positive charge or entering a negative charge is proportional to the
   magnitude of the charge.
3. The strength of the field is proportional to the closeness of the field lines—more precisely, it is proportional to
   the number of lines per unit area perpendicular to the lines.
4. The direction of the electric field is tangent to the field line at any point in space.
5. Field lines can never cross.

The last property means that the field is unique at any point. The field line represents the direction of the field; so if
they crossed, the field would have two directions at that location (an impossibility if the field is unique).

      18.6 Electric Forces in Biology
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       • Describe how a water molecule is polar.
       • Explain electrostatic screening by a water molecule within a living cell.

      Classical electrostatics has an important role to play in modern molecular biology. Large molecules such as proteins,
      nucleic acids, and so on—so important to life—are usually electrically charged. DNA itself is highly charged; it is the
      electrostatic force that not only holds the molecule together but gives the molecule structure and strength. Figure
      18.24 is a schematic of the DNA double helix.




      FIGURE 18.24 DNA is a highly charged molecule. The DNA double helix shows the two coiled strands each containing a row of nitrogenous
      bases, which “code” the genetic information needed by a living organism. The strands are connected by bonds between pairs of bases.
      While pairing combinations between certain bases are fixed (C-G and A-T), the sequence of nucleotides in the strand varies. (credit: Jerome
      Walker)

      The four nucleotide bases are given the symbols A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), and T (thymine). The order of
      the four bases varies in each strand, but the pairing between bases is always the same. C and G are always paired
      and A and T are always paired, which helps to preserve the order of bases in cell division (mitosis) so as to pass on
      the correct genetic information. Since the Coulomb force drops with distance (            ), the distances between the
      base pairs must be small enough that the electrostatic force is sufficient to hold them together.

      DNA is a highly charged molecule, with about     (fundamental charge) per             m. The distance separating
      the two strands that make up the DNA structure is about 1 nm, while the distance separating the individual atoms
      within each base is about 0.3 nm.

      One might wonder why electrostatic forces do not play a larger role in biology than they do if we have so many
      charged molecules. The reason is that the electrostatic force is “diluted” due to screening between molecules. This
      is due to the presence of other charges in the cell.

      Polarity of Water Molecules
      The best example of this charge screening is the water molecule, represented as          . Water is a strongly polar
      molecule. Its 10 electrons (8 from the oxygen atom and 2 from the two hydrogen atoms) tend to remain closer to
      the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nuclei. This creates two centers of equal and opposite charges—what is called
      a dipole, as illustrated in Figure 18.25. The magnitude of the dipole is called the dipole moment.

      These two centers of charge will terminate some of the electric field lines coming from a free charge, as on a DNA
      molecule. This results in a reduction in the strength of the Coulomb interaction. One might say that screening
      makes the Coulomb force a short range force rather than long range.

Cell Membranes
Other ions of importance in biology that can reduce or screen Coulomb interactions are        and       and   .
These ions are located both inside and outside of living cells. The movement of these ions through cell membranes
is crucial to the motion of nerve impulses through nerve axons.

Recent studies of electrostatics in biology seem to show that electric fields in cells can be extended over larger
distances, in spite of screening, by “microtubules” within the cell. These microtubules are hollow tubes composed
of proteins that guide the movement of chromosomes when cells divide, the motion of other organisms within the
cell, and provide mechanisms for motion of some cells (as motors).




FIGURE 18.25 This schematic shows water (          ) as a polar molecule. Unequal sharing of electrons between the oxygen (O) and hydrogen
(H) atoms leads to a net separation of positive and negative charge—forming a dipole. The symbols       and    indicate that the oxygen side
of the      molecule tends to be more negative, while the hydrogen ends tend to be more positive. This leads to an attraction of opposite
charges between molecules.

You are likely familiar with the role of electrical signals in nerve conduction and the importance of charges in cardiac
and related activity. Changes in electrical properties are also essential in core biological processes. Ernest Everett
Just, whose expertise in understanding and handling egg cells led to a number of critical experimental discoveries,
investigated the role of the cell membrane in reproductive fertilization. In one key experiment, Just established that
the egg membrane undergoes a depolarizing "wave of negativity" the moment it fuses with a sperm cell. This change
in charge is now known as the "fast block" that ensures that only one sperm cell fuses with an egg cell and is critical
for embryonic development.

Bioelectricity and Wound Healing
Just as electrical forces drive activities in healthy cells and systems, they are also critical in damaged ones.
Scientists have long known that injuries or infections are managed by the body through various responses, including
increased white blood cell concentrations, swelling, and tissue repair. For example, human cells damaged by
wounds heal through a complex process. But what triggers it?

Physicists and biologists working together at Vanderbilt University used an ultra-precise laser to uncover the
processes organisms use to repair damage. Lead researchers Andrea Page-Degraw and Shane Hutson and study
author Erica Shannon discovered that immediately upon damage, cells release calcium ions and eventually other
molecules, driving an electrochemical response that initiates the healing process. Shannon notes that different
types of damage lead to different chemical releases, demonstrating how organisms may initiate specific responses
to best address the injury.

While far more research is required to understand the triggering and response method, other research indicates that
bioelectricity is highly involved in wound healing. Several studies have indicated that precise and low-level electrical
stimulation of wounds (such as those from surgeries) leads to faster healing. While the mechanisms are not fully
understood, electrical stimulation is a growing area of research and practice in medicine.

      Conductors contain free charges that move easily. When excess charge is placed on a conductor or the conductor is
      put into a static electric field, charges in the conductor quickly respond to reach a steady state called electrostatic
      equilibrium.

      Figure 18.26 shows the effect of an electric field on free charges in a conductor. The free charges move until the
      field is perpendicular to the conductor’s surface. There can be no component of the field parallel to the surface in
      electrostatic equilibrium, since, if there were, it would produce further movement of charge. A positive free charge is
      shown, but free charges can be either positive or negative and are, in fact, negative in metals. The motion of a
      positive charge is equivalent to the motion of a negative charge in the opposite direction.




      FIGURE 18.26 When an electric field is applied to a conductor, free charges inside the conductor move until the field is perpendicular to
      the surface. (a) The electric field is a vector quantity, with both parallel and perpendicular components. The parallel component ( ) exerts
      a force ( ) on the free charge , which moves the charge until               . (b) The resulting field is perpendicular to the surface. The free
      charge has been brought to the conductor’s surface, leaving electrostatic forces in equilibrium.

      A conductor placed in an electric field will be polarized. Figure 18.27 shows the result of placing a neutral
      conductor in an originally uniform electric field. The field becomes stronger near the conductor but entirely
      disappears inside it.




      FIGURE 18.27 This illustration shows a spherical conductor in static equilibrium with an originally uniform electric field. Free charges move
      within the conductor, polarizing it, until the electric field lines are perpendicular to the surface. The field lines end on excess negative
      charge on one section of the surface and begin again on excess positive charge on the opposite side. No electric field exists inside the
      conductor, since free charges in the conductor would continue moving in response to any field until it was neutralized.


        Misconception Alert: Electric Field inside a Conductor
        Excess charges placed on a spherical conductor repel and move until they are evenly distributed, as shown in
        Figure 18.28. Excess charge is forced to the surface until the field inside the conductor is zero. Outside the
        conductor, the field is exactly the same as if the conductor were replaced by a point charge at its center equal to
        the excess charge.

  FIGURE 18.28 The mutual repulsion of excess positive charges on a spherical conductor distributes them uniformly on its surface. The
  resulting electric field is perpendicular to the surface and zero inside. Outside the conductor, the field is identical to that of a point
  charge at the center equal to the excess charge.




  Properties of a Conductor in Electrostatic Equilibrium
  1. The electric field is zero inside a conductor.
  2. Just outside a conductor, the electric field lines are perpendicular to its surface, ending or beginning on
     charges on the surface.
  3. Any excess charge resides entirely on the surface or surfaces of a conductor.


The properties of a conductor are consistent with the situations already discussed and can be used to analyze any
conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. This can lead to some interesting new insights, such as described below.

How can a very uniform electric field be created? Consider a system of two metal plates with opposite charges on
them, as shown in Figure 18.29. The properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium indicate that the electric
field between the plates will be uniform in strength and direction. Except near the edges, the excess charges
distribute themselves uniformly, producing field lines that are uniformly spaced (hence uniform in strength) and
perpendicular to the surfaces (hence uniform in direction, since the plates are flat). The edge effects are less
important when the plates are close together.




FIGURE 18.29 Two metal plates with equal, but opposite, excess charges. The field between them is uniform in strength and direction
except near the edges. One use of such a field is to produce uniform acceleration of charges between the plates, such as in the electron gun
of a TV tube.

Earth’s Electric Field
A near uniform electric field of approximately 150 N/C, directed downward, surrounds Earth, with the magnitude
increasing slightly as we get closer to the surface. What causes the electric field? At around 100 km above the
surface of Earth we have a layer of charged particles, called the ionosphere. The ionosphere is responsible for a
range of phenomena including the electric field surrounding Earth. In fair weather the ionosphere is positive and the
Earth largely negative, maintaining the electric field (Figure 18.30(a)).

In storm conditions clouds form and localized electric fields can be larger and reversed in direction (Figure
18.30(b)). The exact charge distributions depend on the local conditions, and variations of Figure 18.30(b) are
possible.

If the electric field is sufficiently large, the insulating properties of the surrounding material break down and it
becomes conducting. For air this occurs at around                N/C. Air ionizes ions and electrons recombine, and we

      get discharge in the form of lightning sparks and corona discharge.




      FIGURE 18.30 Earth’s electric field. (a) Fair weather field. Earth and the ionosphere (a layer of charged particles) are both conductors. They

      fields can be larger. At very high fields, the insulating properties of the air break down and lightning can occur. (credit: Jan-Joost Verhoef)

      Electric Fields on Uneven Surfaces
      So far we have considered excess charges on a smooth, symmetrical conductor surface. What happens if a
      conductor has sharp corners or is pointed? Excess charges on a nonuniform conductor become concentrated at the
      sharpest points. Additionally, excess charge may move on or off the conductor at the sharpest points.

      To see how and why this happens, consider the charged conductor in Figure 18.31. The electrostatic repulsion of
      like charges is most effective in moving them apart on the flattest surface, and so they become least concentrated
      there. This is because the forces between identical pairs of charges at either end of the conductor are identical, but
      the components of the forces parallel to the surfaces are different. The component parallel to the surface is greatest
      on the flattest surface and, hence, more effective in moving the charge.

      The same effect is produced on a conductor by an externally applied electric field, as seen in Figure 18.31 (c). Since
      the field lines must be perpendicular to the surface, more of them are concentrated on the most curved parts.




      FIGURE 18.31 Excess charge on a nonuniform conductor becomes most concentrated at the location of greatest curvature. (a) The forces
      between identical pairs of charges at either end of the conductor are identical, but the components of the forces parallel to the surface are
      different. It is   that moves the charges apart once they have reached the surface. (b)      is smallest at the more pointed end, the charges
      are left closer together, producing the electric field shown. (c) An uncharged conductor in an originally uniform electric field is polarized,
      with the most concentrated charge at its most pointed end.

      Applications of Conductors
      On a very sharply curved surface, such as shown in Figure 18.32, the charges are so concentrated at the point that
      the resulting electric field can be great enough to remove them from the surface. This can be useful.

      Lightning rods work best when they are most pointed. The large charges created in storm clouds induce an opposite
      charge on a building that can result in a lightning bolt hitting the building. The induced charge is bled away
      continually by a lightning rod, preventing the more dramatic lightning strike.

      Of course, we sometimes wish to prevent the transfer of charge rather than to facilitate it. In that case, the
      conductor should be very smooth and have as large a radius of curvature as possible. (See Figure 18.33.) Smooth
      surfaces are used on high-voltage transmission lines, for example, to avoid leakage of charge into the air.

      Another device that makes use of some of these principles is a Faraday cage. This is a metal shield that encloses a

volume. All electrical charges will reside on the outside surface of this shield, and there will be no electrical field
inside. A Faraday cage is used to prohibit stray electrical fields in the environment from interfering with sensitive
measurements, such as the electrical signals inside a nerve cell.

During electrical storms if you are driving a car, it is best to stay inside the car as its metal body acts as a Faraday
cage with zero electrical field inside. If in the vicinity of a lightning strike, its effect is felt on the outside of the car
and the inside is unaffected, provided you remain totally inside. This is also true if an active (“hot”) electrical wire
was broken (in a storm or an accident) and fell on your car.




FIGURE 18.32 A very pointed conductor has a large charge concentration at the point. The electric field is very strong at the point and can
exert a force large enough to transfer charge on or off the conductor. Lightning rods are used to prevent the buildup of large excess charges
on structures and, thus, are pointed.

Graaff generator has a smooth surface with a large radius of curvature to prevent the transfer of charge and allow a large voltage to be
