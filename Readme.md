# Engram

Engram is a model of human brain's ability to learn and recall information. This is presented as a library to add human like memory and cognitative functions to your applications. Engram is not a traditional database, neither it is like a vector database. Engram is a memory system that can learn from data, form connections like human nurons does using their dendrites and axons, and recall information based on cues. The memory is stored as pathways and connections in a active system that mimics the human brain. Like human brain, connections in Engram can strengthen or weaken over time based on usage and relevance. Here forgetting is a natual feature, not a bug. Engram is a model of brain that keeps evolving, optimizing and adaptiong continiously and also forgetting irrelevant information. 

The model is designed to have a hipocampus process, which continiously processes incoming data and forms new connections and pathways. The model also has a neocortex process, which is responsible for long term storage and retrieval of information. The neocortex process also optimizes the memory structure for efficient recall. 

Each stimulation to the Engram memory is called a cue. Updates happens continiously with or without queue, like human brain. Cue will be used to teach and also recall information. The more cues are used to recall information, the stronger the connections becomes. 

Human brains dont store text, images, videos or any other data files. Human brains store patterns and connections. Engram mimics this behavour by storing data as patterns and connections, so the type of data being stored is irrelevant. Engram can store any type of data, as long as it can form connections and patterns. The nature of these stored information is by Engram's design is lossy, just like human brain.

Engram will become the natural brain for AI systems.
